glories of the names, form, qualities and pastimes of Bhagavān in this world. The ceremony to honour the <i>ācārya</i> who, sitting on a throne in the service of Bhagavān, preaches His glories and attracts people towards Him is called <i>vyāsa-pūjā</i>. Another name for <i>vyāsa-pūjā</i> is <i>guru-pūjā</i>. In India, the general convention is that <i>guru-pūjā</i> is observed on the day of Guru-pūrṇimā. It is considered Vyāsa’s appearance day, and on that day all <i>sampradāyas</i> worship their respective <i>gurus</i>. But in accordance with the scriptures, the primary <i>ācārya</i> of modern times, Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, established special worship of the <i>guru</i> on that <i>guru’s</i> own specific appearance day.

Otherwise it would be impossible for the <i>jīvas</i> to ever receive auspiciousness.

Inside the eternally perfected associates of Kṛṣṇa, the essence of the <i>saṁvit</i>- and <i>hlādinī-śaktis</i> is always present in the form of <i>prema-bhakti</i>. Until the <i>jīva</i> receives that essence, he will not possess any real auspiciousness. The <i>guru</i> is a resident of the spiritual world, and he descends into this world. He brings the <i>prema</i> of Goloka Vraja to this world and bestows it upon the conditioned souls. Such a great personality, an eternally perfected <i>rāgātmikā</i> devotee who possesses <i>vraja-prema</i> and brings it to this world, is known as a <i>śuddha-guru</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> As the current of the Gaṅgā carries water from the Himālayas down to the ocean, there is a current flowing through our <i>guru-paramparā</i> which, beginning from Kṛṣṇa Himself, has come down to the modern <i>ācāryas </i>and is presently flooding the entire material world with <i>kṛṣṇa-prema</i>. This is the primary function of the <i>guru</i>. If someone is not able to give this <i>prema</i>, then he is not really a <i>guru</i> at all.

He composed the different Purāṇas and the <i>Mahābhārata</i> and finally, in order to make Vedānta-sūtra easily understandable, he himself manifested the spotless <i>mahā-purāṇa</i>, <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>, as the commentary on <i>Vedānta-sūtra</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> “All the religious societies in India believe that somehow or other they are followers of Vyāsa (<i>vyāsānuga</i>).

Gāyatrī is feminine in gender. Who is Gāyatrī? We hear that she is the wife of Brahmā, but you should know what has been told in the <i>gāyatrī-mantra</i> – <i>bhargo devasya dhīmahi</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>Bharga</i> means ‘power’; that is, <i>hlādinī-śakti</i>, or <i>mahābhāva-svarūpa</i> (Śrīmatī Rādhikā). The supreme reservoir of <i>kṛṣṇa-prema</i> is Rādhikā. We learn that Gāyatrī is the wife of Brahmā, but who is she actually? She is a <i>gopī</i>. Kṛṣṇa had told Yogamāyā, “You should somehow try to give this <i>gopī</i> to Brahmā; otherwise she cannot be <i>parakīya</i> (My paramour beloved).”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> All the <i>gopīs</i> are married to other <i>gopas </i>and in this way, <i>parakīya-rasa</i> takes place. Kṛṣṇa therefore ordered Yogamāyā to arrange a marriage for Gāyatrī-devī also, so that her love for Kṛṣṇa and her relationship with Him could also be <i>parakīya</i>. This is why Gāyatrī came to be given to Brahmā in marriage. She actually had no love for Brahmā; she loved only Kṛṣṇa. This <i>parakīya</i> mood is topmost, and because she had that mood, Gāyatrī became the maidservant of Śrīmatī Rādhikā. We see that Gāyatrī is the essence of all the Vedic literatures. Gāyatrī is Rādhikā, or Her maidservant, so that mood may come to anyone who serves the <i>gāyatrī-mantra</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> This is a special thing. I have never told this before.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Vyāsa-pūjā, <br>Alachua, Florida, 1 February 2003</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ***********</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> What is <i>vyāsa</i>? The line that touches the opposite sides of the circumference of a circle, by going through the central point, is called the diameter, or <i>vyāsa</i>. What is the meaning? Kṛṣṇa is the centre of all. This circle comprises not only this world, but so many universes – crores and crores of universes. Vyāsa is touching Kṛṣṇa and going to all the innumerable ends of material existence. Who is Vyāsa? He who is preaching the glories of Kṛṣṇa to all, teaching everyone: “You should serve Kṛṣṇa; otherwise no one can save you from this endless chain of birth and suffering.” Vyāsa is he who is always serving Kṛṣṇa from one end of this creation to another – everywhere in this world.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ***********</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> After some time Vyāsadeva divided the Vedas in four – <i>Ṛg Veda</i>, <i>Sāma Veda</i>, <i>Yajur Veda</i> and <i>Atharva Veda</i>. After that he wrote the essence of all the Vedas, and that was called <i>Brahma-sūtra</i>, <i>Sarika-sūtra</i>, or <i>Vedānta-sūtra</i>. After that he wrote thirty-six kinds of Purāṇas: Purāṇas, Upa-Purāṇas and Śakha-Purāṇas. Then, for all persons: for ladies, for <i>śūdras</i> and for those who always lament and who are entangled in worldly intoxications, he wrote the <i>Mahābhārata</i>; and in that he gave the jewel-like <i>Gitopadeśa</i>. Prior to this he gave <i>Catuḥ</i><i>-ślokī</i> <i>Bhāgavatam</i>, which Nārada had received from Brahmā. But still Vyāsadeva had not realized <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>, yet and so he was not satisfied.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Nārada came to him and asked, “Why you are so upset?”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Vyāsadeva replied, “Gurudeva, I do not know.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Nārada then told him, “You have not glorified Kṛṣṇa and His Vṛndāvana pastimes, and you have not discussed how the <i>gopīs</i> and all the Vrajavāsīs serve Him. You should glorify Him, and especially His many devotees, His <i>preyasīs</i> (the <i>gopīs</i>) and His beloved Rādhikā.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Vyāsadeva then saw all the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa and His associates in his trance, and thus he wrote <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> and became happy. The essence, therefore, of all Vedic literature – the Upanisads, Purāṇas and Bhāgavatam – is <i>vraja-prema</i>, or <i>gopī-prema</i>, and especially the love and affection of Śrīmatī Rādhikā, who controls Kṛṣṇa and always keeps Him in Her heart.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> A <i>guru</i> can give these truths; without receiving them from him, it is not possible to understand these mysterious truths. A <i>guru</i> gives all this to the <i>śiṣya</i> (disciple) so that the <i>śiṣya</i> will one day become happy.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Appearance Day of Śrī Śrīmad Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja<br>Singapore, 11 February 2001</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ***********</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> On this day, a disciple or <i>ācārya</i> bows down at the lotus feet of <i>śrī</i> <i>gurudeva</i>, from whom he has obtained all kinds of knowledge.

Śrīmatī Rādhikā is always weeping, intoxicated in <i>kṛṣṇa-prema</i>. Kṛṣṇa laments and suffers for Her, but He does not become as maddened with love as She does.

He does this so expertly that the <i>sādhaka</i> barely notices, but all the while the needful is accomplished.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> This is what the bona fide <i>guru</i> and genuine Vaiṣṇavas do.
