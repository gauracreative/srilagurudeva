the appearance day of <i>jagad-guru</i> Śrīla Prabhupāda, who is most worshipful, is established according to the teachings of the Gauḍīya <i>ācāryas</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> On this occasion of <i>vyāsa-pūjā</i>, I have been ordered to serve this spiritual magazine, which is like one of Śrīla Gurudeva’s bodily limbs. I fully realize my complete incapacity to do so, and am therefore calculating my misfortune. Those who are <i>guru-dāsa</i>, honourable servants of <i>śrī guru</i>, are my sole well-wishers, able to deliver me from this calamity. To remain under their guidance is the pinnacle of service to <i>śrī guru</i>. I therefore offer my sincere prostrated obeisances at the lotus feet of all of the servitors of Śrīla Gurudeva.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Regarding them to be my fellow Godbrothers and dealing with them in a mood of friendship, or<i> sakhya</i>, I have differed with them. But now, after Śrīla Prabhupāda’s disappearance, I realize in the core of my heart just what I have done, and am thus condemning my life. O servitors of Śrī Guru, it is you who are the true worshippers of <i>vyāsa-pūjā</i>. Please bestow your merciful glance upon me. Please do not neglect me upon seeing my worthlessness, but kindly engage me in <i>dāsya</i>, or servitude, through glorification of Śrī Guru and Gaurāṅga. This is my heartfelt prayer at your lotus feet.</p> <div class="border border-saffron-300 rounded-md shadow my-8 px-8 py-8 bg-orange-100 bg-spacer bg-center"> <img class="object-contain sm:max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/storage/uploads/cAmPdDex6rC3MV2j5X4xjNtMbs8qYwhsZ4olb6F9.jpeg" alt="" /></div> <h3 class="ce-header"> The Svarūpa, or Embodiment, of Śrīla Gurudeva</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Following in the footsteps of Śrī Vyāsa and Vaiyāsaki (Śrī Śukadeva), the servitors of <i>śrī guru</i> have informed me about Śrī Gurudeva through scriptural statements such as “<i>gaura-jana-saṅ</i><i>ga kara gaurā</i><i>ṅ</i><i>ga baliyā – </i>associate with the followers of Gaura, knowing them to be non-different from Gaurāṅga”; “<i>ācārya</i><i>ṁ</i><i> mā</i><i>ṁ</i><i> vijānīyāt – </i>know the<i> ācārya </i>to be My own self<i>”</i>; and<i> </i>“<i>sāk</i><i>ṣ</i><i>ād-dharitvena samasta śāstrai</i><i>ḥ – </i>all scriptures concur that <i>śrī guru</i> is Hari Himself”. At the same time, however, the servitors of <i>śrī guru</i> have instructed me to consider him as the dearest associate of Hari – <i>kinto prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In <i>Śrī</i> <i>Caitanya-caritām</i><i>ṛta</i> (<i>Ādi-līlā</i> 1.45), Śrīla Kavirāja Gosvāmī has also elucidated the position of <i>śrī guru</i> by saying, “<i>guru kṛṣṇ</i><i>a-rūpa hana śāstrera pramā</i><i>ṇe</i> – all <i>śāstras</i> corroborate that Śrī Guru is non-different from Kṛṣṇa.” He continues, “<i>guru-rūpe k</i><i>ṛṣṇa kṛ</i><i>pā karena bhakta-ga</i><i>ṇe – </i>in the form of <i>guru</i>, Śrī Kṛṣṇa bestows mercy upon His devotees.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Accordingly, the statements of the <i>mahājanas</i> and the examples provided in the scriptures establish clearly that <i>śrī guru</i> is the <i>svarūpa</i>, or embodiment, of Bhagavān. In the same way, I acknowledge the servitors of <i>śrī guru</i> as non-different from Bhagavān also, and consider them my <i>śik</i><i>ṣ</i><i>ā-gurus</i>. In <i>Śrī Caitanya-caritām</i><i>ṛta</i> (<i>Ādi-līlā</i> 1.47), Śrīla Kavirāja Gosvāmī has said, “<i>śik</i><i>ṣ</i><i>ā-guruke ta’ jāni k</i><i>ṛṣṇ</i><i>era svarūpa</i> – one should know the <i>śik</i><i>ṣ</i><i>ā-guru</i> to be the <i>svarūpa</i>, or embodiment, of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> O eternal servitors of <i>śrī guru</i>, the sole reason you have appeared in this material world is to deliver those like me, the lowest of mankind, who have fallen in the mire of sin. Although I have heard your transcendental teachings about the supra-mundane nature of Śrīla Gurudeva, my conception of him as a mortal being has not dimmed even slightly. Delusion and malice are the root cause of this.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> Vāṇī-kīrtana
– Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Innermost Desire</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>Vā</i><i>ṇ</i><i>ī</i>, or sound, is received through one sensory organ only – the ears. In other words, the other four senses are impotent to receive it. It is impossible to approach an object that lies beyond the senses, through the medium of the senses. Indeed, we attain auspiciousness to the extent we are able to limit the involvement of the senses. This is precisely why <i>śrava</i><i>ṇa</i> (hearing) and <i>kīrtana</i> (chanting) are considered superior to the other limbs of <i>bhakti</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> If my mentality of considering <i>śrī guru</i> to be a mere mortal has not vanished after hearing the <i>kīrtana</i> of transcendental instructions from your lotus mouths, then my performance of the limbs of <i>bhakti</i> executed through the other senses is futile also. What doubt can there be about this? In the present age, every limb of <i>bhakti</i> needs to be performed in conjunction with <i>kīrtana</i>. Although limbs of <i>bhakti</i> other than <i>śrava</i><i>ṇa</i> and <i>kīrtana </i>exist, they do not bestow the highest result without <i>kīrtana</i>. Therefore, by the boundless mercy of you all, I have been able to understand that <i>kīrtana</i> is independent and the topmost <i>sādhana</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Only <i>bhakti</i> characterized by <i>śrava</i><i>ṇa</i> and <i>kīrtana</i> con-stitutes preaching and is <i>bhāgvata-mata</i>, the <i>mano’bhī</i><i>ṣṭa</i> of Śrī Caitanya, whereas <i>bhakti</i> that involves the construction of <i>maṭhas</i> and temples, service to the deities (<i>arcana</i>) and so on, is <i>pā</i><i>ñcar</i><i>ātrika-mata</i> (the system of formal deity worship). You have allowed me to understand that the sole ontological reason for Śrīla Prabhupāda’s appearance was to preach the conceptions of the <i>bhāgavat-paramparā</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>Kīrtana</i> is the sole fruit of <i>kīrtana</i>. <i>Kīrtana</i> alone is <i>sevā</i>, and <i>kī</i><i>rtana</i> is also <i>prema</i>. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has written in his <i>Krama-sandarbha</i>: “<i>yadyapyanyā bhakti</i><i>ḥ kalauḥ</i><i> kartavya tada kīrtanākhya bhakti-samyogenaiva ityuktam</i> – in Kali-yuga, the limbs of <i>bhakti</i> other than <i>kīrtana</i> are also to be performed, but only in conjunction with <i>kīrtana</i>.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Prabhupāda has himself said, “Let there be representatives of the <i>pā</i><i>ñcar</i><i>ātrika</i> process. Let the temples be constructed and the deities worshipped. But those who belong to the better class, the higher class, engage in preaching activities. To propagate <i>vaikuṇṭ</i><i>ha-nāma</i> everywhere is the most cherished desire of Mahāprabhu. ... Our preaching process should be like this. Let pamphlets be printed profusely; it does not matter whether or not the <i>maṭhas</i> and temples are erected.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Even in his final instructions, Śrīla Prabhupāda specifically cautioned us: “We have not come to this world as masons to deal with stone or wood. We are the peons of Śrī Caitanyadeva’s message.” Let people practise any one or several of the limbs of <i>bhakti</i> independently of <i>kīrtana</i>: we shall practise only <i>kīrtanākhyā-bhakti</i>, as instructed by Śrīla Prabhupāda.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> One Must “Present One’s Ears” to Hear the Vāṇī</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Because I maintained the conception that Śrīla Prabhupāda was an ordinary human being, none of his words ever entered my ears. Therefore, he would often say, “First prepare your ears (develop transcendental <i>śraddhā</i>). By doing so, you will attain the qualification to hear the <i>siddhānta</i> of the <i>Bhāgavata</i>.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Now I realize in the core of my heart the essence of this instruction. Although I remained by Śrīla Prabhupāda for about eighteen years (till 1937), his teachings on what is ultimately beneficial and what is temporarily pleasing (<i>śreya</i><i>ḥ</i> and <i>preyaḥ</i>), on following and mere imitation (<i>anusaraṇa</i> and <i>anukaraṇa</i>), on what is real and what is fake (<i>asala</i> and <i>nakala</i>), on ontology and morphology, on spirituality and ordinary conduct (<i>pāramārthika</i> and <i>vyavahārika</i>), and on associating with a transcendental personality’s form and teachings (<i>vapu</i> and <i>vā</i><i>ṇ</i><i>ī</i>), as embodied by the <i>Gauḍ</i><i>īya</i> magazine, did not enter my ears, nor could I realize the difference between these categories.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Therefore, I pray to the servitors of Śrī Guru to help me first ‘present my ears’. Until I ready my ears for this purpose, I will be the subject of the statement “<i>upadeśo hi murkhānam prakopaya na śāntaye</i> – instructions given to fools serve only to anger them, not pacify them.”</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> The Transcendental Body of Śrīla Prabhupāda </h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Due to my misfortune, I never became qualified to perceive the body of Śrīla Prabhupāda as a transcenden­tal, eternal deity full of knowledge and bliss – although you all educated me on this repeatedly. Upon noting my mundane conception of him, Śrīla Prabhupāda would, from time to time, sweetly and knowingly enact being ill. Endowed with wicked intelligence, I would approach to serve him, trying to touch his body with my material hands, etc.; but remaining autonomous, he would at once present his illusory form (<i>māyā-deha</i>) and captivate my demoniac propensity [to ‘serve’ him for my own interest].</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In reality the transcendental body of Śrīla Prabhupāda cannot be diseased or possess any abnormality – but at that time I could not understand this even slightly. How can I, a complete sense enjoyer (<i>kāmī</i>) and a <i>yogī</i>, like Rāvaṇa, touch anything other than <i>māyā</i> – in other words, the illusory Sītā? Where is the qualification to touch Sītā, the embodiment of the transcendental potency (<i>cit-śakti</i>), who is Lakṣmī, residing on the lap of Śrī Rāma?</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I could not realize anything about the transcendental nature of Śrīla Prabhupāda, having been cheated of his real mercy – and thus I have been deprived forever. Such is the result of not allowing his fully conscious words to enter my ears. This indeed is my extreme misfortune.</p> <div class="border border-saffron-300 rounded-md shadow my-8 px-8 py-8 bg-orange-100 bg-spacer bg-center"> <img class="object-contain sm:max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/storage/uploads/yZTU1NpaoiB3vL5tCX5fLuLo4ewkxoHnlksU6Rv8.jpeg" alt="" /></div> <h3 class="ce-header"> Disappearance Pastime of the Ācārya</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Prabhupāda observed that a wicked person like me, who egotistically considered himself to be his servant, had started brimming with such arrogance that at every step and every moment he was intent on usurping Śrīla Prabhupāda’s position, regarding himself to be equal to him. At that time, Śrīla Prabhupāda decided to teach a lesson to a sinful person like me, who is eternally conditioned and whose mentality is harder than stone, non-combustible like mica and dry like fire, by suddenly manifesting an extremely unbearable pastime that was harder than a thunderbolt and had even more burning power than fire.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In 1936, just before concealing his manifest pastimes, Śrīla Prabhupāda was residing at Puruṣottama Maṭha atop Caṭaka-parvata in his appearance place, Śrī Purī-dhāma. Observing my reluctance to follow his instructions, he said to me, ‘‘No one understands and accepts my message anymore. There is therefore no use for me to remain in this world; it is best that I leave.” At that time, I was unable to understand his compassionate intention and protested. And to my great misfortune, he unexpectedly struck me with this thunderbolt at dawn on Thursday, 1st January 1937.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Prabhupāda saw me as a sense enjoyer and an <i>ahaṅ</i><i>graha-upāsaka</i>, one who identifies himself with his object of worship. To bestow upon me the teaching of <i>bhakti-rasa</i> endowed with renunciation<i> </i>(<i>vairāgya-yuga</i> <i>bhakti-rasa</i>), he many times expressed his desire for me to accept the renounced order of life (<i>sannyāsa</i>); but because of my misfortune, I could not accept it at that time. Therefore, to teach me renunciation, which can destroy my mentality of identifying myself with the body and the attachment to anything related to the body, he enacted his disappearance pastime.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> Words of Consolation at the Time of His Departure</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> To console me, the dear most associates of <i>guru</i> have acquainted me with the statements of Śrī Śukadeva, the son of Vyāsa, in the thirty-first chapter of the Eleventh Canto of <i>Śr</i><i>īmad-Bhāgavatam</i>, which recount Śrī Hari’s departure:</p> <div class="my-8 text-saffron-300"> <div class="text-xl font-semibold text-center"> rājan parasya tanu-bhṛj-jananāpyayehā<br />māyā-viḍambanam avehi yathā naṭasya<br />sṛṣṭvātmanedam anuviśya vihṛtya cānte<br />saṁhṛtya cātma-mahinoparataḥ sa āste </div> <div class="text-base italic mt-3 text-center ml-36"> &ndash;Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (11.31.11) </div> </div> <p class="ce-paragraph"> O King, you should apprehend that a stage actor remains unchanged, even though while on stage before his audience he accepts various roles in which he enacts birth and death. Similarly, the acts of Kṛṣṇa, the Supersoul of all, in which He takes birth and disappears in the Yadu dynasty, may resemble the birth and death of embodied beings, but this is simply an act of His illusory potency. In reality the Supreme Personality, Bhagavān Himself, has created this universe and entered it as its Supersoul, to enact His divine play. Again, at the time of destruction, He annihilates and winds up the entire creation within Himself, and then passively situates Himself in His own transcendental glory.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The eternal form of the <i>ācārya­deva</i> is composed of knowledge and bliss and remains constitutionally unchangeable – just like a dramatic performer [who appears to go through various transformations during his performance, but remains the same unaltered person]. On the stage of this world, the <i>ācāryadeva</i> merely acts out birth, death and so forth, all of which we can perceive using our knowledge-acquiring senses. The birth and death of an ordinary living entity is filled with pain and suffering, but the appearance and disappearance of the spiritual conscious form of the <i>atimartya ācārya</i>, who is beyond the control of the material nature, is full of joy. To astonish his audience, a magician may use a weapon to execute a person standing before him. An ignorant child cries upon seeing this, but those who know better understand that the killing is merely an illusion and do not lament for the person ‘slain’.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> While the unbearable disappearance pastime of the <i>ācārya</i> is like a stage act, an ignorant person like me who does not comprehend this cannot be consoled. Thus, I perceive his disappearance pastime, which is full of joy, to be extremely painful and heart-rending. Thus, while the servants of <i>śrī guru</i> are feeling true separation, I am lamenting like a <i>śūdra</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I have heard from you all that <i>viraha</i>, separation, enhances the elegance of service; and when anything that stimulates remembrance of one’s object of worship appears on the path of one’s vision, it progressively makes one’s attachment for that object unflinching. Separation looks to enhance the highest pleasure of one’s worshipful object.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In the state of lamentation, however, the bound <i>jīva</i> becomes bewildered, and thus inactive: his energy and capacity disappear and he becomes afflicted by grief. Due to the absence of service, one cannot see in him any transformation akin to an enhancement of joy. Thus, I – like an ignorant fool, a <i>śūdra</i> – have become overwhelmed by lamentation. I am unable to discover any enthusiasm within. “<i>Hṛṣ</i><i>īke</i><i>ṇa hṛṣ</i><i>īkeśa-sevana</i><i>ṁ</i>... – to serve the master of the senses with my senses” has become a formidable task for me.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> The Ācārya’s Affection For His Devotees</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> On the appearance day of Śrīla Prabhupāda, all that stirs in my mind is the account of his disappearance. That is why I am experiencing grief at a time of joy. Seeing my misery, the embodiment of auspiciousness, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in order to inspire me, exhibits his appearance day each year soon after the day of his disappearance. With the hope of again having his <i>darśana</i> through you, his dear-most associates, I have presented myself at your lotus feet. When one is deprived of meeting, the intense pain of separation is relieved only by death. Therefore, to console his devotees’ affliction caused by separation, Śrīla Prabhupāda has shown his mercy by manifesting his appearance pastime shortly after that of his disappearance. This is the distinctive quality of his tremendous compassion and <i>bhakta-vatsalya</i>, which I am unable to properly express in words.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> The Ācārya’s Arrival in Śrī Dhāma</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Prabhupāda doubted that we would heed his instructions. Full of natural pride in his eternal identity, he adopted a grave and silent mood, intending to come to the bank of his ever-dear Śrī Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Under­standing his inner intention, the Vaiṣṇavas, as Viṣṇudūtas, carried him on their heads and placed him in an espe­cially well-decorated chariot that had many compartments (a metaphor for the special train that carried his body). As Śrīla Prabhupāda entered the largest and most exquisite compartment with his dearest servants, other servants followed, entering their respective chambers.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> That Goloka chariot on the Earth planet had come for Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s dearest, and it now travelled at high speed and, without interruption, reached Śrī Kṛṣṇa-dhāma (a metaphor for Kṛṣṇanagara, near Navadvīpa) in the blink of an eye. The <i>raṇa-kṣetra</i>, or battlefield (a metaphor for Raṇa-ghāṭa, the place of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s maternal home where he had spent his early childhood), is where the battle between knowledge and realization (<i>vidya</i> and <i>vedana</i>) took place. As the driver stopped here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the <i>ācārya</i>, reminded me of his childhood pastime of acquiring knowledge, even though he was inherently possessed of realized knowledge. Like Badhva Ṛṣi, he apprised me of many things, without actually speaking. [Vāskali, the disciple of Badhva Ṛṣi, inquired from his teacher three times about the nature of <i>brahma</i>. By maintaining silence, Badhva Ṛṣi satisfied his enquiry. Since <i>brahma</i> lies beyond material words, silence was the appropriate response to his question. Similarly, Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke to Śrīla Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja through his silence – and reminded him of the teaching that the material ears have no power at all to grasp the divine instructions of <i>śrī guru</i>.]</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> At that time, I could not understand anything he was saying to me, due to my ignorance; but I fully realized that any attempt to hear the <i>vā</i><i>ṇ</i><i>ī</i>, or divine instructions, from the personification of transcendental <i>vā</i><i>ṇ</i><i>ī</i> using one’s material ears is futile.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Travelling from Kṛṣṇa-dhāma, the embodiment of <i>śrī-vā</i><i>ṇ</i><i>ī</i>, Śrīla Sarasvatī Prabhu, reached Gaura-dhāma, which is non-different from Kṛṣṇa-dhāma. There, at Śrī Svānanda-sukhada-kuñja he met with Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura to inform him of his arrival. From there he went to the bank of Śrī Rādhā-kuṇḍa, which was manifested by the <i>ācārya</i> of Śrī Caitanya Maṭha on the premises of Candraśekhara Ācārya-bhavana at Śrī-Dhāma Māyāpura, where he met with Śrīla Gaura-kiśora dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Nearby, on the bank of the <i>kuṇḍa</i> in Sevā-kuñja, he was decorated with flowers, garlands, sandalwood paste and various other ingredients collected by this degraded person. After this unfortunate person beautified his bodily lustre (<i>lāva</i><i>ṇya</i>) [This refers to the placing of salt around his body.] Śrīla Prabhupāda situated himself in <i>samādhi</i> as the dear most associate of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Madana-mohana. To give me the eligibility to render service to the Divine Couple under his guidance, he took up residence there forever. I now pray to the servants of Gurudeva that they may mercifully bestow upon me a fraction of the qualification needed to serve Gurupāda-padma in fulfilling his most cherished desire.</p> <div class="my-8 text-saffron-300"> <div class="text-xl font-semibold text-center"> namaḥ oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhūtale<br />śrīmate bhakti-siddhānta-sarasvatīti-nāmine<br />namaste gaura-vāṇī śrī-mūrtaye dīna-tāriṇe<br />rūpānuga-virudhāpa siddhānta-dhvānta-hāriṇe õ </div> </div> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Translated from the ‘Prabandhāvalī’ of Śrī Śrīmad Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja<br>(First published in Rays of The Harmonist No.16, Kārttika 2006)</p> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/contact" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a></div> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/livewire/livewire.js?id=90730a3b0e7144480175" data-turbo-eval="false" data-turbolinks-eval="false" ></script><script data-turbo-eval="false" data-turbolinks-eval="false" > if (window.livewire) { console.warn('Livewire: It looks like Livewire\'s @livewireScripts JavaScript assets have already been loaded.
