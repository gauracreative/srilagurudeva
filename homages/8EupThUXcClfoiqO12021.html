class="ce-paragraph"> <i>ajnana-timirandhasya jnananjana-salakaya<br>caksur unmilitam yena tasmai sri gurave namah</i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>mukam karoti vacalam pangum langhayate girim<br>yat-kripa tam aham vande sri-gurum dina-taranam</i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> To properly glorify Sri Guru, one must understand who he is. To understand him, one must serve him. And to serve him, one must follow his instructions. As a disciple of Srila Gurudeva in name only—someone who has not followed his instructions, not rendered any service to him, and certainly not understood who he is—I have no hope of being able to offer an homage suitable for the occasion of his centennial <i>vyasa-puja</i>. But remembrance of the pure devotee always brings auspiciousness, so for the sake of my own purification, I will endeavor to recount a few of Srila Gurudeva’s pastimes that he kindly allowed me to witness. May he graciously forgive any faults in my recollection of these episodes and allow the lessons that he sought to impart with them to enter into my heart.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The scriptures of the Gaudiya Vaisnava canon all extol the virtues of the <i>sad-guru</i>. From the Sanskrit verses of the ancient <i>Upanisads </i>to the Bengali compositions of Gaudiya <i>acaryas </i>such as Srila Narottoma Dasa Thakura and Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, they all express the compassion and beneficence of the fully realized personalities who come to this world solely for the sake of delivering the Supreme Lord’s mercy and saving the conditioned souls.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I was fortunate to have some exposure to these works from a young age, in the books and lectures of Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada. I would often wonder where the “bona fide spiritual master” that Srila Prabhupada frequently mentioned could be found. I used to wish that Prabhupada could be my guru, but he had already disappeared from this world years before I was born. Sometimes I would feel despondent about whether I could ever meet a spiritual master of such a high caliber.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> By the grace of Srila Prabhupada, my family eventually came to hear of an exalted personality named Sri Srimad Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja from several followers of his who attended our home programs. We were immediately attracted by their descriptions of his saintly qualities and also by the copies of his books and lectures that they gave us. Over the course of several months, our desire to meet him grew stronger and stronger.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The devotees encouraged us to go to Srila Gurudeva’s annual <i>harikatha </i>festival in New Braja (Badger, California), but there were a variety of obstacles in the way. Just as it began to seem impossible that we would ever have his <i>darsana</i>, through a number of incredible circumstances my family somehow reached Badger in June 1998. We were a few days late to the festival and arrived in the middle of his morning class. He saw us approaching the pandal and interrupted his lecture for a moment to invite us to sit.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> And so began Srila Gurudeva’s affectionate guardianship over my entire family. From that moment on, he would accept us as his own and guide us away from the darkness of material existence and onto the luminous path of bhakti. Whether we understood an iota of our good fortune or not, he would forever maintain his loving watchfulness over us.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It continues to astound me that we once had the opportunity to be in the presence of such a transcendental personality. Clearly, Srila Gurudeva was not of this world. His body had all the symptoms of a <i>maha-purusa</i>, his complexion held a lovely golden radiance, and all his movements were graced with a special artistry and sweetness. His brilliant blue eyes—the features that would immediately draw attention when one encountered him for the first time—were like windows into the spiritual realm. Each of his attributes combined to make an ethereally beautiful figure who could only be an eternal associate of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> But even more remarkable than his external features were his internal ones. Srila Gurudeva embodied every single quality that the learned personalities of the past have related in their poetry and songs. He was fully versed in all philosophical subject matters and could answer any question posed to him with numerous references to both ancient and modern Vaisnava texts. He was completely renounced from the material world, without even a hint of interest in mundane wealth or prestige. And he was also the personification of humility and unparalleled in his compassion for others.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Indeed, Srila Gurudeva’s generosity toward the souls of this world defies description. At an advanced age, he went abroad more than thirty times to disseminate the doctrine of pure bhakti everywhere. Although he could have remained fully immersed in his <i>bhajana </i>within the holy <i>dhama</i>, he accepted many hardships to travel to some of the remotest locations of the earth and encourage everyone to chant the holy name. His pure association transformed the lives of countless individuals, and his message of love uplifted all who were fortunate enough to hear it.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> He showed my family tremendous kindness by staying at our house once each summer during the last few years of his manifest pastimes, thus allowing us to witness his wonderful qualities at close range and in vibrant detail. With ordinary people, when one spends time with them in a familiar environment, all their flaws and hypocrisies become apparent, but with Srila Gurudeva it was the opposite experience. The extent of his perfection, and the complete alignment between his words and his actions, was truly astonishing to behold.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Although he was an eternally liberated associate of the Lord, he played the part of the ideal <i>sadhaka </i>to demonstrate how to engage in the process of <i>bhakti-yoga</i>. Of course, his standard of devotional practice was so high that it was totally inconceivable for someone like me.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Every moment of his day and night was devoted to the service of his worshipable <i>guru-pada-padma</i> Sri Srimad Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Gosvami Maharaja, Gauranga Mahaprabhu, and the Divine Couple. Even when his health was fragile, he continued to translate and provide commentary on the sacred Vaisnava texts, as instructed by his spiritual master many decades earlier. To ensure the continuation of pure bhakti, he illuminated the most confidential of scriptures and revealed the most unprecedented of spiritual knowledge. The books and articles he wrote constitute a veritable treasure-house for present and future generations of Gaudiya Vaisnavas.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I recall how sometimes Sripad Madhava Maharaja would leave Srila Gurudeva’s writing tray outside of his room in order to give him an opportunity for rest. However, Gurudeva would come outside searching for the tray and take it back inside his room himself. It seemed far too heavy for him to carry on his own, and we would try to take it from him, but he always insisted on carrying it himself.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva was continually under the guidance of his holy master. I remember passing by his door one morning when he was narrating to Sripad Madhava Maharaja the instructions that he had received from Srila Parama-Gurudeva in his dream the prior night. Gurudeva’s surrender to his spiritual master was automatic and fixed. Even when he would yawn, he would immediately say, “Jaya Gurudeva.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Among my most cherished memories of Srila Gurudeva is his morning lecture on the first day of Kartik in 2008. This was, of course, also the disappearance day of Srila Parama-Gurudeva. Speaking in Bengali, he beautifully described how even though he had taken birth in a place of barbarians, his supremely munificent guru-maharaja had saved him from the ocean of material existence by grasping his <i>sikha </i>and placing him into the nectarean service of Sri Sri Radha-Krsna. Deep in separation, he was openly weeping as he described Srila Parama-Gurudeva’s exceptional contributions to the Gaudiya Vaisnava community. Gurudeva’s <i>guru-nistha</i> knew no bounds.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Completely dedicated to carrying out the mission of his spiritual master, Srila Gurudeva was exceedingly disciplined and regulated in his daily routine to maximize the time available for his writing and other services. He performed activities at exactly the same time each day, often relying on a tiny old pocket watch that he would carry with him. He was especially punctual about the timing for chanting his <i>gayatri </i>mantras.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> One time, Srila Gurudeva had the door to his room open while doing his <i>ahnika</i>, and I had a brief glance at his sitting form, which was the very picture of concentration. Whenever I hear Srila Gurudeva’s lectures about how we should always chant the mantras given to us by our guru with great honor and respect, I reflect on the image in my mind of him doing exactly that. Gurudeva was very tall, but in his older age, he had become a little more stooped in posture. However, this was not at all the case when he did his <i>ahnika</i>. He was sitting up so straight that he appeared to be about 8 or 9 feet tall, and his right arm was at an exact perpendicular angle to his body. He remained perfectly still, so immersed was he in chanting his mantras with care.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In the mornings, Srila Gurudeva would sing beautiful songs, very softly, in a barely audible voice, that sounded like music descended directly from the spiritual world. In my entire life, I have never heard anything more lovely and euphonic. And in the evenings, as he would chant <i>harinama</i>, the entire room would be filled with a golden-saffron light that seemed to emanate directly from his transcendental body. There are no words to describe how captivating he looked in those moments.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> We hear of the devotion and renunciation of the Six Gosvamis in Srila Srinivasa Acarya’s <i>Sad-Gosvamyastakam</i>. Our Srila Gurudeva embodied these qualities as well. He lived so simply, accepting only those things that were absolutely essential to the maintenance of his body. He wore ordinary cotton cloth that was soft from use and repaired where holes had developed. He also took the simplest foods—only a little bit of fruit in the morning, and at noon and in the evening, very plain vegetables cooked with few spices and no ghee. He would never accept anything opulent for himself and always engaged whatever he received in the service of Sri Sri Guru and Gauranga.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It was evident that money held no attraction for him whatsoever. When I was in Badger in 2008, I was fortunate to observe his interaction with one of his disciples. She brought him some flowers along with a check for $68,000. He scolded her a little, saying, “What is this? Didn’t you already give me $18,000 or $24,000 just a few days ago?” She explained that she would like to give him everything that was hers. Gurudeva wiped a tear from his eye, and then he tore the check into many pieces and returned it to her hands, explaining, “No, this will not happen. This cannot happen. Even if the money stays with you, it will be mine.” Seeing that she had started to feel badly because he was not accepting her offering, he added, “In the future, you will give me even more—a lot more.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I heard later that Srila Gurudeva’s prediction came true. This devotee understood that he was giving her a test. Srila Gurudeva wanted to see whether she had any lingering attachment for the money she was offering. She became resolved in her desire for him to accept her donation, so the next year she gathered up her additional earnings and wrote him a check for $108,000, which Srila Gurudeva mercifully accepted for the construction of his temples in Sri Govardhana and Sri Navadvipa Dhama.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> When Srila Gurudeva stayed in our house, he demonstrated through his example how simply and without any material attachments he expected us to live as well. My family’s house would be considered small by Western standards, but Srila Gurudeva referred to it as a <i>raja-prasada</i> (palace fit for a king). He also made a remark about a tiny old television set that was in our living room, which we only used for occasionally watching the news. Gurudeva would brook no compromise on the path of bhakti and, through these lessons, instructed us to give up our worldly desires.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva came to our house four times in total, each visit for about three to five days, including during the summer before his disappearance from this world. We had been requesting him to visit for years, but as he became advanced in age, it seemed an impossibility so we eventually stopped asking. Then very unexpectedly, he told us himself that he would come to our house the next year when we saw him in Los Angeles during the summer of 2006. Srila Gurudeva’s heart was softer than a lotus flower. Whenever someone asked him for a benediction, he could not refuse that person.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> During each of his visits, he was accompanied only by Sripad Madhava Maharaja and Brajanath Prabhu, which gave our family the opportunity to do simple services for him that he mercifully accepted in spite of our imperfect efforts. He played little tricks on us, including the first year when one of his servants assured us multiple times that Srila Gurudeva would have lunch on the airplane while traveling from Houston and would not take anything at our house until dinner, but then upon arriving in the early afternoon, he told us that he was hungry. My mother was only partially done with her cooking, so she had to rush to prepare some dosas out of soaked rice and mung dal while Sripad Madhava Maharaja quickly cooked up some chickpeas that were already boiled—hardly the kinds of items she had ever imagined offering to Srila Gurudeva. In her immense consternation and shame over the circumstances, my mother also spilled an entire pot of cooked rice, something that had never happened to her in the past nor has happened since.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> When he came out of his room and granted us his <i>darsana </i>later in the day, he asked whether we take rice at noon. He was not upset in the least, just rather bemused, but we were all so embarrassed, especially my mother. The next day, she put her full concentration and energy into cooking a proper lunch, being very careful to heed Madhava Maharaja’s instructions regarding Gurudeva’s diet. She had never been more nervous in her life.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> About an hour after lunch was over, as we were cleaning the kitchen, Srila Gurudeva made a sudden appearance. I had been organizing some vegetables in the refrigerator and didn’t even see him until he was nearby. “Everything was very tasteful,” he said to my mother in Bengali. Then he turned around and walked slowly back to his room.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> With these pastimes, Srila Gurudeva made sure we understood that we are not able to do anything for him without his mercy. As a <i>maha-bhagavata </i>who is completely under the shelter and protection of the Lord, he does not need anything at all from us. He only accepts some service out of immense compassion and also out of the desire to attract the conditioned souls to the path of bhakti.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Whenever Srila Gurudeva glorified his own <i>guru-maharaja</i>, he spoke not only of his inconceivable potencies but also of his loving exchanges with his disciples and followers. Our Srila Gurudeva, too, was such an expert in stealing the hearts of his disciples. We experienced this directly the very first time he visited our home. By engaging with us like a member of the family—including teaching my sister and me how to chant, how to sing kirtans, and how to study the sastras; giving my sister the opportunity to decorate his room and make elaborate garlands for him; allowing my mother to cook for him three times a day; and involving my father in various personal services—he enabled us to feel a happiness unlike anything we have ever experienced and he took our hearts in his pocket when he left.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I possess neither the intelligence nor the understanding nor the words to venerate a rarefied personality such as our Srila Gurudeva. My neophyte endeavor to do so here has undoubtedly been less successful than that of the dwarf who wishes to capture the moon.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>Jagad-guru nitya-lila pravista om-visnupada astottara-sata</i> Sri Srimad Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja is a direct associate of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and also of the Divine Couple. His qualities are transcendental and unlimited. On the most auspicious occasion of the one-hundredth anniversary of his divine appearance on this earth, I pray to him that one day he will bestow upon me the qualification to realize even a drop of the ocean of his glories—and that one day I will develop a speck of understanding of my immense good fortune to have once had the opportunity to take the dust of his beautiful lotus feet upon my head.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Fallen and insignificant,<br>Kundalata Dasi</p> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/srilagurudeva/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/livewire/livewire.js?id=90730a3b0e7144480175" data-turbo-eval="false" data-turbolinks-eval="false" ></script><script data-turbo-eval="false" data-turbolinks-eval="false" > if (window.livewire) { console.warn('Livewire: It looks like Livewire\'s @livewireScripts JavaScript assets have already been loaded.
