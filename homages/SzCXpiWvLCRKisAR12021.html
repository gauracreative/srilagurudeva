bhāgyavān jīva<br>guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I offer my humble obeisances at the lotus feet of my beloved Gurudeva, Sri Srimad Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It was my <i>aho-bhagya</i> to have been blessed with shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Gurudeva. Words cannot describe his glories, yet I attempt to offer my <i>puspanjali </i>at his lotus feet with few inadequate words.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Dear Gurudeva,</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Whenever I remember about the time when I was able to serve you, then only these two things come to my heart:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 1. You are never really gone from this world, you only disappear from this planet, from my material eyes – just like the sun goes away at night but alas! It’s giving light, heat and comfort to some other part of the planet;</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 2. You are the effulgent reflection of <i>vipralambha-bhava</i> and deliverer of <i>suddha-prema-rasa</i> that resides in the beautiful, evergreen and ever melodious land of Vraja which belongs to the <i>gopis</i>, that has been brought to this planet just for the progression of devotees like me and so many millions – who are hankering for something higher in life than just going around and around -- like a goldfish in the glass bowl of this material world.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Dear Srila Gurudeva, for any young child who is growing up, there are parents and relatives that protect and feed the child while he/she grows up. But you are the eternal gardener that plants the seed of bhakti in the heart of a willing and able devotee, you are the chosen one who feeds it water with your <i>prema </i>(loving attitude) and <i>siksa </i>(guidance in pure-devotion), protects it from the forces of <i>maya, </i>like a goat tries to uproot the seedling and eventually ensures that the <i>bhakti</i>-<i>lata</i> (devotional creeper of service) reaches the land of Vraja where the flowers that sprout from the <i>bhakti-lata</i> can be offered to the lotus feet of <i>gopis</i>, who will eventually offer it in the service of the most influential, beautiful and attractive love-engrossed couple – Sri Radha Krishna.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I feel that without your presence on this planet, without your teachings, without your <i>pracara </i>(preaching tours), without your books, without your <i>harikatha </i>(discourses on Krsna), without your <i>parikramas</i> (circumambulations bare-foot), without your <i>sanga </i>(devotee association) and without your <i>kirtanas </i>-- I would have missed so much in this lifetime, that my life would be considered a waste even if I would have won a million lotteries. You taught us that that all the material wealth comes and goes like the morning-fog comes to engulf a morning walker only until there is bright sunshine. So, I give all the credit, respect, devotion and my time towards the realization of all the things you wanted to teach us when you came here.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Right from the time when my family moved from Jaipur to Delhi, I continued to miss the <i>laddu-prasadam</i> that was served in the Sri Radha Govindadevaji temple (Jaipur) and I used to pray when someone would come from Jaipur who could bring the <i>prasadam </i>for me. Never did I know, that something much more astonishing, sweet and utterly-revealing in path of bhakti was going to happen after all my prayers were going in vain for so many years living in the new cosmopolitan city. Nevertheless, I kept praying each day and I used to pray when I used to visit the ISKCON temple in East of Kailash that you arranged for me miraculously, by allowing my father to get an official residential property (free of cost to my family) that was so close to the temple that I could walk to it in just 15 minutes. You see my Srila Gurudeva, when I moved to Delhi, I was a mere student who knew nothing beyond school marks, score-cards, playing in the evening with friends, respecting parents/teachers for everything they do for me and beyond that make as many friends as I could at the age in the evening sports. But all-in-all, I still missed my life back in Jaipur where every month we used to wake-up early and attend the <i>mangala-arati</i> of Sri Radha Govindadevaji and we used to do <i>parikrama </i>of the entire temple, only to return to the Sri Rama Mandira built by the Birla Company.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> After staying in South-Delhi for several years, you finally revealed to me in the form of sweet <i>harikatha</i> at Sri Beri Prabhuji’s home in East of Kailash, on the first floor. I remember that the first time my mother took me to meet you, as I was climbing the stairs towards meeting you the first time, but I stopped! I felt strongly that I had left something important at home. And then for the longest time, I kept having the feeling that I have left some gravely important at my house. I could not remember what I had left at the time and I kept on recalling it while listening to your first <i>katha</i>. Now, after twenty years I have come to a realization what I had left behind, was my sense of belonging with <i>maya </i>(material desire, desire for fame and fortune and false-pride). Before climbing those stairs for the first time, you reminded me and it was like you had (internally) warned me that after meeting you, I shall never be able to go back to being a person who could live without <i>harinama </i>(chanting) and I will stop being be a person hankering just for money, pride and false-ego from college degrees.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> After meeting you in such a surprising way, I had no realization that you would accept me in your association and that you would begin to change my life in such a foundational way that it would almost seem unnoticeable till the time when I met you again for a <i>harikatha </i>session at Beri Prabhu’s home, just before travelling to Holland for the first time. Decidedly, I was afraid to leave India for the first time, leave the comfort of my two-bedroom apartment, the comfort of my mother’s home-cooked food, my bed and my most beloved friend circle. But right after meeting you, my mother allowed me to come sit at your lotus feet and she asked me to share my fear(s) with you. You at once listened to me like there was no one else in that room apart from you and me only. Once you heard my material fears and you mentioned that I should speak with Brajanatha prabhu about various Gaudiya Mathas in Holland/Europe then you called me again and asked me to follow the four regulative rules of <i>vaishnavism</i>. Once I listened to you and promised at your lotus feet then I gave you my word and I said “Yes, dear Gurudeva as I roam the streets of Europe I shall not eat meat, I shall not drink alcohol, I shall not gamble and I shall not engage in unauthorized physical relations with any female,” then you at once said “<i>bas itna karo abhi, aur tumhe bhakti milegi aur krsna raksha karenge</i>” meaning “That’s it do this religiously and you shall progress in the path of bhakti and Krsna will take good care of you. Go without ANY fear!”.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I touched your lotus feet and I made a decision to myself in the long-haul flight that I would never break my promise to you, Srila Gurudeva. As soon as I landed in Holland airport, I took my luggage and I took the first train in the early morning hours around 3 AM and I remembered the nice moments that I had shared with you and with my family before I left, as I stared outside the train’s window -- into a foggy but bright early morning Sun in Holland! Just while I was reminiscing in the memories, it dawned on me that I am in a new country, new language, new set of people and new roads and I had no idea where to go to -- once the train come to a stop! I panicked and then I stood up in the last ten minutes of my journey and got off my stop on foot. I did not know who to trust and who to rely on, after I came DOWN from the station stairway. Now, I remembered the stairway I had climbed UP when I met you and cried in my heart that no one was there to protect me apart from your sweet memory and my promise to you.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> And something astonishing happened which was that a Dutch man dressed in clean, green clothes, wearing a sharp-hat appeared in front of me, as I was trying to find where to go from the station. I had only a paper printout of the booking of my hotel, no mobile phone, no money to pay for phone calls and no way to contact my family from there. This was my first trip, away from home, in a land that my family had never seen, touched or heard about so I was not aware of anything. I approached this man with extreme caution and hesitancy, but since he appeared to be mature, with a smile he said “Namaste!” to me and he asked "Are you new to the country?" and I said “Yes!”. Now, by this time a million things were racing through my mind and I was extremely cautious of approaching this man who I didn't know, didn't trust and had no idea what his intentions were and yet he mentions to me with a big smile “Dear sir, would you mind keeping your suitcase on my bicycle and see my shoulders are strong, so don’t worry that I will won’t drop your luggage. You can walk with me on the other side of my bicycle and I know everything about this area and so I can take you to a comfortable place where you can stay”. While he was walking with me from my station to the hotel (it was a good 30 minutes walk), he spoke eloquently about the church nearby belonging to St. Jan and he spoke softly to me about all the places where I can eat vegetarian food, where I can come to relax (and do my <i>harinama</i>), where I can come to meet other fellow God-serving humans (God-loving <i>sanga</i>) and I can also stay away from ill effects of <i>maya </i>of moving to a new country. Once I reached the hotel and I told this man "Let me check-in to my room and I will come down to talk in detail with you." When I came back down, that man was nowhere to be found. I stayed in that city for next two years and I never saw that man again! Srila Gurudeva, I feel to this day that this moment will never fade away from my heart (and mind!) and that moment in time, was a miracle in my life and I am still touched by the mercy you performed on me.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> After many years, when I moved to Houston due to my job, I had no idea that you will again come to Houston to meet me, to establish the grounds where a new Gaudiya Matha (temple) was to be made. This divine event had opened the doors for me to perform more <i>seva </i>for you, at the new Sri Radha Govindaji Gaudiya Math and for all the devotees who are so lovingly attached to this temple. It took many years for the temple to be finished by 2011 and by then you left this planet to go to Goloka dham to serve conjugal Sri Radha Krsna (as <i>Ramana-manjari</i>). We were distraught seeing you leave from our vision, but you had left the world after making sure that a new diamond is in our hands where we can bask in its glory, listen to <i>harikatha </i>from your <i>sanga </i>and offer our <i>seva </i>to Thakurji and Radharani and never feel alone.</p> <div class="border border-saffron-300 rounded-md rounded-b-none shadow my-8 bg-orange-100 bg-spacer bg-center"> <div class="px-8 py-8 w-full"> <img class="object-contain sm:max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/storage/uploads/HSN6QQS1aQqqfJyuYFfGEfAJ5vt8yZko2hoBTqO0.jpeg" alt="Srila Gurudeva - Dream Darshan" /> </div> <div class="px-8 py-4 text-lg font-bold text-center text-white bg-saffron-300"> Srila Gurudeva - Dream Darshan </div></div> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Just recently in 2017, when I was going through a traumatic experience of breakup of the wedded-ties in my life, as I was now single-handedly responsible to raise a two-year-old boy in Houston. One night when I was heartbroken, alone and in tears I performed my <i>harinama </i>until I fell asleep praying to your lotus feet for mercy. And then that night, you came in my dreams and I suddenly realized I was in your room in Vrndavan (Rupa-Sanatana Gaudiya Matha, India). I am able to remember the dream so clearly like it happened with me for real. I kept waiting for you at the door-step, inside your room, and then you finally came wearing saffron clothes (your head was covered since it was summer) and you spoke firmly to Madhava Maharaja while you were describing a fast-horse (probably my wife) which could not be controlled due to her anger and her immense greed. You exclaimed to Madhava Maharaja “Leave that horse, if she is so greedy and so angry all the time, go drop and leave her in some forest!” Then you finally came into your room, where my brother and I were waiting on the side and we watched you take seat on the bed. You immediately informed both of us with a big smile, that it is time for preparing the fire-sacrifice for my diksa and why have we both not cleaned the sacred sandalwood of all its loose-dry soil that sticks to it. You then sat on the floor with me and we both cleaned the sacred wood while you chanted the Damodarastakam. Then you prepared the entire <i>havana-kunda</i> with me and then you said “… the puja is this evening so I need to now take a bit of rest”. Then you personally instructed me to gently massage your lotus feet and slowly you went to sleep and asked me to continue chanting Hare Krsna <i>mahamantra</i>… "(This dream <i>darsana </i>(appearance) that Srila Gurudeva showed me was recently captured in a photo which is attached below in my offering. I had never seen this photo before he appeared in my dream!)</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Dear Srila Gurudeva, I have not forgotten the moments that I used to be able to listen to your <i>harikatha </i>in Somnath Prabhuji’s house in Delhi, and the times when I met you personally in Beri Prabhuji’s home in South-Delhi, and now that you are not part of this world’s vision so you have left treasures like diamonds for us to maintain and grow. Those treasures are the following:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 1. The <i>harinama bhajana-sraddha</i> (commitment) that you instilled in your sons/daughters all over the world;</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 2. The Sri Radha Govindaji Gaudiya Matha, where I wish to be a humble servant all my life;</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 3. The <i>harikatha </i>that you left behind for us to relish, that’s why I am performing your <i>seva </i>in Audio-Seva team as much as I can;</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 4. The sacred texts and books that you left for us to read, which will lead future generations to come;</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 5. The art of <i>kirtana </i>which will attract new souls and new <i>jivatmas </i>(living entities) into bhakti.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 6. The senior devotee-<i>sanga </i>(devotee circles in India, USA and all around the world) which will continue to give the taste of <i>harinama </i>and Guru-<i>bhajana </i>to millions of new devotees.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 7. And finally, the art of making <i>prasadam </i>which you used to lovingly accept from devotees in South-Delhi and Vrindavan and US (in the Houston <i>sanga</i>). That’s why I have now learnt how to cook so that I can offer it to you, so you can offer it to Sri Radha-Krsna with your own hands, being a Ramana <i>manjari.</i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I still consider myself the fortunate little boy who is always greedy at the window of Sri Radha Govinda-dev Ji temple to eat the sweet <i>motichur-laddus</i> and while praying to Him to get more, more and more, I got your lotus feet and the whole process towards unalloyed and unmotivated pure-bhakti of Sri Radha Krishna (performed only by the <i>Gopis </i>in Vraja).</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> And I hope to serve you more in my existing life and even more in my next life… just like I yearn for more <i>prasadi-laddus</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Will you be my spiritual master and the chosen eternal gardener for my <i>bhakti-lata bija?</i></p> <h3 class="ce-header"> trnad api su-nicena taror iva sahisnuna, <br>amanina mana-dena kirtaniyah sada harih</h3> <h3 class="ce-header"> vancha-kalpatarubhyash
