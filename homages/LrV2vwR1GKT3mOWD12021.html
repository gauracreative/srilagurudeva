My biggest service when Gurudev used to stay in our home was to make him a flower garland every day, sometimes twice a day. </div></div> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>ajnana-timirandhasya jnananjana-salakaya<br>caksur unmilitam yena tasmai sri gurave namah </i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Although I grew up in the US, I was fortunate to be born into a pious Indian family. I didn’t actually know I was fortunate, at the time, though. I went through the motions of chanting and puja and everything else because it was what my family did. It wasn’t from the heart.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I met Gurudeva when I was 10 years old. I wish I could remember that moment, the way that I hear so many others speak about Srila Gurudeva, but I can’t. I was too foolish and wretched to value the great personality who had just entered my life. But it didn’t matter. He took mercy on me, anyway, so that after years of going to see him with my family, I grew to love him as a daughter, if not the disciple that I should have been.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> When he played the pastime of being ill in 2010, I did not believe that he would leave us. A year or two before, at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Houston temple, I could vividly remember Gurudeva saying that he would come back for the grand opening. Gurudeva could not lie. The temple was not open yet, so it was not time. It took a long time for me to reconcile this. How could he break his promise? It wasn’t until the grand opening of the Houston temple that I understood. He was there. Gurudeva does not need a physical body. He was there. And I felt closer to him then than I ever had felt before. I should have realized that sooner, as Gurudeva had proven his greatness to me twice before.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> When I was in college, I was working very hard on my studies and was perpetually tired. I would often dose off in the middle of chanting my rounds. But I didn’t have time to redo them, so I would sometimes pull the counter beads down, counting my mini naps as a round, even though I knew I was half asleep for most of it and had not chanted through all of the beads. One day when Gurudeva was staying in our home, he left his room to go with my father to the local park for his morning walk. No one else was directly around at the moment. As he passed me, he looked directly at me with his beautiful, piercing blue eyes and said, “Always chant 16 rounds…never less.” He knew.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> A second time he read my mind, he was in our living room for daily darshan. He just finished answering a question from my father and then he suddenly looked at me and said very strongly that we must chant and remember or return to this world as hogs or dogs. It might have sounded a little harsh because, afterwards, my mother came to tell me that Gurudeva wasn’t saying that for me; he was reminding us all. I knew better. Gurudeva was saying it just for me. He was answering the questions I wouldn’t dare say out loud or even really think. He read my heart. And then he told me to read Jaiva Dharma and all my questions would be answered.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It was after the temple grand opening at Houston that I finally obeyed him. I couldn’t bring myself to do it for years. So, on Aksaya Tritya I made a vow that I would read a chapter every week, and then I did. It changed my life. Not because all my doubts were removed, not because I fell in love with Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura’s words, but because I finally listened and did something that Gurudeva had ordered me to do. Only then did I become a real disciple and come to appreciate Gurudeva for the great personality that he was.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva led by example, a true <i>acarya </i>and embodiment of <i>trinadapi sunicena</i>. He was always so humble, giving honor to everyone, even those who didn’t deserve it. And his teachings were flawless, always giving hope and a path to achieving pure bhakti, true love of Godhead.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> He would say, “We shouldn’t think that ‘oh, I will never get Krishna’ or ‘my <i>anarthas </i>will never go away, so how will I get Bhagavan?’ We shouldn’t think this way. We should think ‘I am going to the beautiful <i>dhamas </i>and taking good association.’ Don’t be worried for worldly gain or loss. It may come or go. <i>Nama </i>is everything and Krishna has given it with causeless mercy, so everything is in our hands. The note is in our hands, so go to bank and it will come.” And he would also warn, “Don’t dispute with any <i>vaisnava </i>or mourn for gain or loss. Keep up your enthusiasm. ‘I will get Krishna because I have a <i>sat guru</i>.’ Our greatest fortune is getting a <i>sat guru</i>. If you have a <i>sat guru</i>, by the fruit of good activities, then everything is there. But you must be careful that you do not do any <i>aparadha </i>to Hari, Guru, or Vaisnava. If you are doing everything okay, don’t criticize and don’t do offense on the lotus feet of Guru and Vaisnava. Then everything is okay. Knowingly or unknowingly you should not do. According to your ability, do your services. <i>Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam</i>. Most important is <i>nama sankirtana</i>. The things that are hindrance to bhakti are Mayavadi association, mixing with opposite sex, and those who are against God. There are thousands of disturbances. But if we are like this, then bhakti will come.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Gurudeva’s kindness knows no bounds. His love and affection is spread to all of his devotees. Sometimes it may seem as though Gurudeva is favoring one disciple over another, but this is not true. It was explained to me that Gurudeva is like the sun. The sun shines everywhere but if you go inside, you will not feel the warmth of the sunlight. Gurudeva loves all of us equally, but if some of us choose to stay locked away, as I did for so many years, we cannot collect his mercy. Even though he is not physically with us, his sunlight, his mercy is still shining through every one of his lectures and books that we are so fortunate to have access to. And like the Lord, we can keep him in our hearts by remembering his sweet pastimes.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> My favorite story of Gurudeva was told to me by Sripad Madhava Maharaja. In his human pastimes, Gurudeva had various health concerns that limited what he could eat. Very rarely was he allowed to eat sweets, and if he did, Madhava Maharaja would scold him dearly. One day someone had baked muffins. Although one was offered to him with his lunch <i>prasadam</i>, it was understood that Gurudeva was to accept it with his eyes. When Madhava Maharaja took his remnants away, the muffin looked perfectly in-tact, as when it was offered to him. But when Madhava Maharaja removed it from the plate, he discovered that Gurudeva had eaten much of the insides by picking out the filling from the bottom of the muffin. This was a glimpse of the playful side to Gurudeva that was so sweet, like everything else about him.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Gurudeva always had the most beautiful smile, and he had this glowing effulgence amplified by the adoration of the of his disciples and well-wishers who followed him everywhere like little ducklings unable to survive in the wide-open world without the shelter and protection of their mother. His Bengali was impeccable, his Hindi was melodious, and his English was so endearing. Whenever he said “more louder please” it would melt your heart.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I remember Gurudeva would often take pleasure in reciting <i>Rama-lila</i>. My favorite pastime that Gurudeva would tell was about Hanuman. Sri Sita Devi, Laksmana, and Bharata were all quite unhappy with Hanuman. He was taking all of Lord Rama’s service and leaving nothing for anyone else to do. So, they conspired against him. They told Hanuman that they had a new important service for him, that he should snap his fingers when the Lord yawned. They would take care of everything else. So, they sent Hanuman away with this one task and attempted to serve Lord Rama. But they could accomplish nothing. All day long, the Lord was yawning. He could not eat or sleep or do anything but yawn all day. Sita Devi, Laksmana, and Bharata could not understand it. What was going on? The Lord did not yawn like this before. What could be the cause? They came across Hanuman and found that he was snapping his fingers twenty-four hours a day. When they asked why he was doing so, Hanuman replied, “How will I know when his Lordship is yawning? I must snap my fingers all day.” So, because Hanuman was snapping all day, the Lord accepted his service by yawning all day. Sita Devi, Laksmana, and Bharata understood now, and so they told Hanuman that he could come back and do other service. Together they served the Lord in harmony. When I first heard this story, I was quite young. The moral I learned at the time was that you should not try to steal someone else’s service—it will not end well for you. But as I grew older, I finally understood that what Gurudeva was trying to tell us was that there is nothing that we can do for the Lord. He has everything - he needs nothing from us but our love and affection. But if we try to serve him sincerely, the Lord will accept our service, however small and inconsequential.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Gurudeva was always trying to encourage us like this. He would tell, “I've come to remind you that always you should be very strong. So many problems may be there. Try to smile in the face of suffering. Learn from Prahlada Maharaja. You should think, even death is coming but I will not give up my chanting. Try to realize all this. Don't be weak. Don't think that I am alone. You cannot be alone even if you want to be alone. How can you remove your witness, here? Paramatma, and where Prabhu is there, his servant, Gurudeva is also there serving his lotus feet. You are never alone, ever and ever. When lust and anger come, you should try to control. You should pray, and Mahaprabhu and Gurudeva will come at once. Maintain your life anyhow and chant.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I know firsthand that Gurudeva is always with me. He proved that to me even in his physical pastimes when he ordered me to chant 16 rounds a day because he could see my actions from the other side of the world. Sometimes it is frightening to think that he sees everything I do, good and bad, and hears every <i>adharmic </i>thought that goes through my head. But it is always comforting to know that he is there to guide and save me. Not just in this life, but birth after birth. I was not ready to take <i>diksa </i>at the time that I did, but Gurudeva was so merciful, he gave it to me anyway, knowing that when I was ready, he would not be here physically to provide it. So even when I am not looking for him, he will always find me, and pull me by the ear till I am ready to listen. He is my greatest fortune.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva ki jaya!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Begging for Srila Gurudeva's mercy,<br>Sita Dasi</p> <div class="border border-saffron-300 rounded-md rounded-b-none shadow my-8 bg-orange-100 bg-spacer bg-center"> <div class="px-8 py-8 w-full"> <img class="object-contain sm:max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/storage/uploads/DewCDprI635prYOaWdz0VAti3gKhsFwEHja3qbA8.jpeg" alt="05-2009 – Gurudeva offering flowers in our home temple the third year he stayed with us." /> </div> <div class="px-8 py-4 text-lg font-bold text-center text-white bg-saffron-300"> 05-2009 – Gurudeva offering flowers in our home temple the third year he stayed with us. </div></div> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/contact" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
