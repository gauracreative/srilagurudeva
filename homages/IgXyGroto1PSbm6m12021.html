class="ce-paragraph"> <b>All glories unto the lotus feet of Srila Gurudeva, Nitya Lila Pravista </b><b>Sri Srimad Bhaktivedenta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja and Centennial <i>Vyasa Puja</i></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>11th February 2021</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Born in Tiwaripur village during <i>Amavasya</i> (dark moon) night in the month of <i>Magda</i> (February) 1921. Named Sriman Narayana Tiwari and also known as Bholanatha (a name of Lord Siva meaning ‘god of innocence’) as he was simple hearted and innocent and would not cry and would keep sitting wherever he was seated. Srila Gurudeva is an eternal associate of Sri Sri Radha-Krsna and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. By examples of his life, he revealed the way of developing pure devotion to Sri Sri Radha-Krsna to advance in pure <i>bhakti</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> He also taught us how to acquire <i>sukriti </i>(spiritual credits) by knowingly or unknowingly indulging in devotional service and developing <i>samskaras</i> (impressions felt in the heart from <i>sukriti</i> attained in this lifetime and past lives). To understand the divine nature of Srila Gurudeva’s pastimes we can look at the words of <i>param</i> Gurudeva, <i>nitya lila pravista</i> Sri Srimad Bhakti Prajnana Kesa Goswami Maharaja (quote taken from Rays of The Harmonist, 2011): “The eternal form of the <i>acaryadeva</i> is composed of knowledge and bliss and remains constitutionally unchangeable, just like a dramatic performer who appears to go through various transformations during his performance but remains the same unaltered person. On the stage of this world, the <i>acaryadeva</i> merely acts out birth, death, and so forth, all of which we can perceive using our knowledge-acquiring senses.” Srila Gurudeva performed his divine disappearance pastime on December 29, 2010, causing his disciples worldwide to experience drowning in the waves of separation mood.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Prior to the year 2001, I was living on the Gold Coast and my religious beliefs were in Christianity related to Catholism from my mother’s side and father was into the practices of the Rosicrucians. I was in a dangerous situation, practicing <i>mayavada</i> philosophy and at that time I was feeling like there was no love on the planet and turned to <i>Surya,</i> the Sun God and made a prayer that if this is all the spiritual knowledge of God available in this Bible then I no longer wanted to be living on planet earth.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Not long after this prayer, I moved to Murwillumbah in December 2000 and set up an Acupuncture Clinic. A devotee named Vidyadhari Dasi came to the clinic seeking help for an old head injury and did not have money to pay for the treatment. I mentioned that I have been told that Hare Krsna <i>prasadam</i> was very delicious and that I would be happy to do her treatment in exchange for lunch <i>prasadam,</i> samosa and banana cake delivered to my clinic and to my son Navin at local Steiner School. One day, while I was waiting at Vidhyadhari’s kitchen door for the banana cake to be taken out of the oven, I experienced a supernatural phenomenon of a light beam of energy coming from the altar from the living room, directed to my heart and almost knocked me over like an electric shock. I asked what was on her altar and Vidyadhari said Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu ‘The Golden Krsna’. I said I need to know more about this person and so my journey of Krsna consciousness began.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Vidyadhari gave me Volume 1 of "Krsna, The Supreme Personality of Godhead" by Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and I read it in a week, looking for Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, but was not able to find him and returned it and she gave me Volume 2 that also I read but was not able to find Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the golden Krsna. Vidyadhari also mentioned that her Gurudeva had already come to Murwillumbah in January and to Cessnock in February and normally does not come back to Australia three times and was returning in March to Sydney. We traveled in the old Volvo car to Sydney and talked about Srila Gurudeva as a great <i>Vaisnava</i> and pure devotee. Vidyadhari thought he may give me Yasoda or Yamuna as the spiritual name. We camped in a caravan park near the place that Gurudeva was staying and walked to the house nearby.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I remembered the first time I saw Gurudeva and that he had a golden aura and I felt love emanating from his whole being that filled the whole house and overflowed out into the surrounding environment and made me cry. I wanted to be initiated and receive the <i>maha-mantra </i>on the first day that I heard Gurudeva speak <i>harikatha</i>. On the last day of the festival, I became sad and thought that I was going to miss out on being initiated and given the <i>maha-mantra</i>. Maya Devi was playing trickery on me. When I asked other devotees sitting near me, if I was going to receive initiation, they thought I was talking about <i>diksa</i> <i>mantras</i> and said that I will have to wait for a year at least to receive them and I just cried. When I asked them if I could buy the bead bags so that I could chant, they said only the Guru can give the mantra and the bead bag and I cried even more louder. I heard shouting from the kitchen and turned to see who was calling out and it was Madhava Maharaja who called for me to “come for initiation at 5 am tomorrow morning” and I felt overjoyed in my heart and cried even more.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> When I returned to the tent, I realized that I did not have an alarm clock and was worried that I would not wake up on time. I was awakened by rain drops on my tent, a little before 5 am and when I looked up in the sky there was no rain clouds and was very thankful for the spiritual alarm clock by the grace, mercy and potency of Srila Gurudeva. I went to see Srila Gurudeva feeling extremely excited for the initiation and was given the name Yamuna Devi Dasi and the <i>maha-mantra</i> with a <i>tulasi mala</i> in a white bead bag, it was March 2000 in Sydney Australia. My godbrother and son Navin aged eight year was initiated and given the <i>maha mantra</i> and the name Navin Krsna at the same time by Srila Gurudeva and that the name was Madhava Maharaja’s previous name before he became a sannyasi.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Navin Krsna and I were invited to Mekhala and Vrajavallaba’s home for Sunday programs to listen to <i>harikirtan</i> and learnt how to sing <i>kirtans</i> and play <i>kartals</i>. After I received <i>diksa</i> mantras during Srila Gurudeva’s next visit to Murwillumbah and Navin Krsna received Gopal mantra. By the mercy of Srila Gurudeva’s mystical potency of being a pure devotee, we were given Gaura Nitai deities by the family of Vrajavallaba, Mekhala, Candramukhi and Ragalekha with teachings and advice on how to take care of deities and <i>tulasi seva</i> was also given. The whole volume sets of the Srimad Bhagavatam and Caitanya Caritamrta also came to me when I purchased them from a god sister.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Somehow, through the prayer to <i>Suryadeva,</i> the Sun God, about the limited knowledge in the Bible, I was able to receive into my life a pure devotee Srila Gurudeva (<i>Uttama Bhagavat</i>), which is a rare event according to <i>shastra</i> and I am so grateful for this to have occurred in my life which was otherwise bereft of love. Srila Gurudeva is a pure devotee in the line of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabu, who is both Radharani and Krsna in one body. I was very attracted to the teachings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and felt that when he sent me the beam of energy in my heart at Vidhyadhari’s home alter previously before I became initiated, that was also by the grace, mercy and potency of Srila Gurudeva. By his mercy, I initiated in the line of the <i>Gaudyia Sampradya</i>. Radharani is my worshipable <i>istadev</i>i and she is the <i>shakti</i> potency of Krsna (Radhe! Radhe!)</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> By the grace, mercy and potency of Srila Gurudeva, Vaisnava’s started coming into my life. The first one was Damodara Maharaja, who spoke <i>harikatha</i> at my Acupuncture clinic in Murwillumbah and devotees came to listen in September of 2000. Shyamarani Didi came to my home at Glenock Road, during Christmas of 2001 to give <i>harikatha</i> and I cooked and offered <i>bhoga</i> for my worshipable deities of Gaura-Nitai and offered <i>prasadam</i> to many devotees who came for the festival. Other Vaisnavas such as Tirtha Maharaja, Van Maharaja, Sridhara Maharaja also came to my home to give <i>harikatha</i> over the years and were very affectionate towards my son Navin Krsna who sang <i>kirtan</i> beautifully, chanted the <i>Gopal mantra</i> and served our worshipable deities Gaura-Nitai. Also due to the grace, mercy and potency of Srila Gurudeva, I was able to give healing <i>seva</i> to Srila Gurudeva and all the Vaisnava’s that came to Murwillumbah.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Navin and I travelled to India in 2003 for the month long <i>Vrndavan Parikrama. </i>It was a whirlwind of an experience, travelling on buses, walking kilometres to holy places of worship and temples, listening to <i>harikirtan,</i> absorbed in the energy of Srila Gurudeva and the holy <i>dhaam </i>of Vrndavan, following in the footsteps of great pure devotees and Vaisnavas in our <i>parampara</i> to worship Radha-Govinda. Navin Krsna and I remained in Vrndavan for an extra two months to do healing <i>seva</i> for Shyamarani Didi who was very affectionate and kind to both Navin and I. We received <i>harikatha</i> from both Shymarani and Uma <i>didi</i> during that time. Navin Krsna and I circumambulated the holy <i>dhaam</i> of Vrndavan daily during that time. I am so great-full to have had the association of great Vaisnavis such as Uma didi and Shymarani didi.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I am ever so grateful for the <i>sukriti</i>, spiritual experience and <i>samskaras</i> that I received during that time and those will stay in my heart forever.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> During the <i>parikrama,</i> I remember that somehow, by the grace, mercy and potency of Srila Gurudeva, the word had spread through the Bengali devotees that I was a Nursing sister and I would be approached during the <i>parikrama</i> by Bengali devotees calling out to me “Sister! Sister! I have a cut and need a dressing” and I would set up clinic on the roadside healing my Bengali god-brothers and god-sisters. Gurudeva came in the dreams of one of my god-sisters from Ireland who was a Diabetic and was not well and told her to wake me up at 2 am in the morning to take her to hospital in Delhi and was awakened by one of her twin sons calling out loudly and knocking on my door “Mataji! Mataji! Come and see my mother, she is very sick”. We left in a taxi at 3 am in the morning from Vrndavan to find a hospital in Delhi where we spent over a week whilst she recovered there. By the mercy, grace and potency of Srila Gurudeva, one of the Medical doctors offered to lend her 30,000 Rupees for the cost of the hospital treatments to be paid back when she returned to Ireland after <i>parikrama</i> was over.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I returned to India for Vrndavan <i>parikrama</i> in 2005 and 2006 and had a lot of association with Uma didi and her servant Rangadevi didi and by the grace, mercy and potency of Srila Gurudeva, I was able to hire a four-wheel drive vehicle with a driver to take Uma didi on the <i>parikrama</i>. Uma didi was able to give <i>harikatha</i> along the way and we planned it so that we would be ahead of the crowd to take <i>darshan</i> of deities in temples and places of worship. I am so grateful to have the association of such a great Vaisnavi as Uma didi and this experience, <i>samskara</i> will stay in my heart forever.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva was very merciful to me and very affectionate towards my son Navin Krsna and gave us both <i>guru-seva</i> whenever he came to Murwillumbah for festivals. Navin massaged Gurudeva’s feet with Sripad Madhava Maharaja on several occasions and was invited to sit amongst the <i>sannyasis</i> near Gurudeva during <i>harikatha</i> and I became Gurudeva’s Nurse and Acupuncturist whenever he came to Murwillumbah, Australia. I have a memory of Gurudeva being admitted to John Flynn Hospital on the Gold Coast during one of our festivals in 2008 and he did not want to stay in hospital. I was given a phone call from Sripad Madhava Maharaja to help bring Gurudeva home to Murwillumbah to continue his Intravenous antibiotic therapy. As a Nurse, I knew the renal specialist Dr Campbell and with the help of Maya Devi, who covered the eyes of the JFH Nursing staff, was able to obtain the medical supplies required for free to nurse Gurudeva at home. I have fond memories of Sripad Madhava Maharaja and I taking the supplies needed such as gloves, IV tubing, IV Saline fluids, antibiotics, syringes etc so that we could take care of Srila Gurudeva at home. I remember Sripad Madhava Maharaja having to go to the festival at the Civil Centre to give <i>harikatha</i> whilst I was given the responsibility to administer his intravenous therapy over 30 minutes and was instructed by Sripad Madhava Maharaja to to take good care of Srila Gurudeva whilst he was gone to the festival to give <i>harikatha</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> My chanting increased to 32 rounds during that time and my heart melted when I went to check the Intravenous drip every 10 minutes and Srila Gurudeva would smile so sweetly at me and say, “Is everything okay?” One day during the 7 days of IV treatment I heard the most beautiful singing voice of a young female from Gurudeva’s room and tried to tape it on my mobile phone but was not able to, as it was only for my ears to hear and when I entered the room, I could not see anyone else in the room except for Srila Gurudeva who smiled at me with so much love and affection.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In 2010, when Gurudeva was in ill health close to the time of <i>Kartika</i>, I returned to India and arrived in Delhi where all the devotee healers were doing <i>seva</i> for Srila Gurudeva. We would all meet each morning to discuss Srila Gurudeva’s health and ongoing treatment plan. Part of my <i>seva</i> was to support the team in the background that was nursing Srila Gurudeva directly with advice and training. I remember several nights, waking up in the middle of the night hearing Gurudeva vomiting and running into the courtyard but not able to enter his room to help him directly as only the males were allowed to attend to him in India. I realized how fortunate I was to be able to directly nurse Gurudeva in Australia. The next day Gurudeva ordered everyone to go to Vrindavan for <i>parikrama</i>. On the bus trip from Delhi to Vrindavan, I was told off by one of my God sisters for thinking that Gurudeva was ordinary as I could not come to terms that he was going through suffering as I was not able to understand <i>nara-lila</i> and cried all the way to Vrindavan feeling separation from Gurudeva.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> On arrival, I settled my worshipable deities Gaura-Nitai in the hostel room and went to the market to buy bananas for <i>bhoga</i> offering. On my way back, I was not able to find the entrance to the hostel that was somewhere in front of <i>Seva-kunja</i>. Whilst I was pacing up and down the entrance of <i>Seva Kunja</i>, a motorcycle thief hooked my backpack that was clipped to my body and dragged me along the ground for a hundred metres with my body stretched in full prostration in front of <i>Seva-kunja</i> entrance and released me, when he could not remove the bag from my body. A Brajavasi Mataji came to my rescue. I was in shock and could not stop crying and then Van Maharaja came around the corner with the <i>sankirtan</i> party on their way to <i>Seva- kunja</i> for <i>Kartika parikrama</i> and the Mataji explained to Van Maharaja what had happened. He ordered me to join the group and not to wander on my own on the streets of Vrindavan. I continued to cry and heard Maharaja announce over the loudspeakers in Seva-kunja about what had happened to me on the streets, to the crowds of devotees present there.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> After that I found the entrance to the hostel in front of <i>Seva-kunja</i> and whilst I was offering <i>bhoga</i> to Gaura-Nitai, I received a knock on my door and a devotee said that Srila Gurudeva wants me to return to Delhi for <i>darshan</i> straight away. I traveled back to Delhi with my worshipable deities and had my last direct <i>darshan</i> with Gurudeva. He was not speaking at all and I was holding his hands and looking into his eyes. I was then told by Srila Gurudeva to return to <i>parikrama,</i> which was now in Govardhan.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 'Walking with a Saint' 2010 book Appendix 3 [Taken from excerpts from the article called “Om Visnupada Astottara-sata Sri Srimad Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja Entered Sri Sri Radha-Ramana Bihariji’s<i> Nitya lila</i>, published in Rays of the Harmonist #24, Kartika 2011:] “Gurudeva had a desire to go to Govardhan during <i>Kartika</i> and his servants took him to Sri Giridhari Gaudiya Matha by ambulance” and I got <i>darshan</i> again from a distance with Uma didi, who climbed up with me onto a concrete wall so that we could see Gurudeva over the crowds of devotees and together we cried in both separation and meeting for Srila Gurudeva. “Srila Gurudeva remained in internal consciousness (<i>antara-dasa</i>) most of the time”. Whilst Srila Gurudeva was residing at the Sri Giridhari Gaudiya Matha in Govardhan, Gurudeva manifested symptoms of ecstasy described by Srila Rupa Gosvami (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu) “sometimes incessant tears would flow from his eyes, sometimes froth from his lotus mouth, and sometimes he would hiccup continuously for hours.” Sometimes he would wake up from sleep and would ask “ has the <i>parikrama</i> gone to Nandagaon today”, or it is Ekadasi today?” All his servants would be astonished that Srila Gurudeva was accurate in his statements and that he was actually attending <i>Kartika Parikrama</i> whilst he was in and out of consciousness during this time in Govardhana. Another amazing <i>lila</i> witnessed by his servants whilst in Govardhan was his desire to go to Vrndavana to perform Braja-mandala <i>parikrama</i>. Srila Gurudeva was pacified when they said that they would arrange it and he settled. Sometime in the evening he would say “Oh, today the <i>parikrama</i> will go to Sri Radha-Damodara Mandira, Seva-kunja, Sri Radha-Syamsundara Mandira, and other nearby places. I cannot go to them all, but I will certainly go to Seva-kunja and Sri Radha-Damodara. Or, today the <i>parikrama</i> is going to Mana-sarovara, it was as if he was directly performing Vraja-mandal <i>parikrama</i>”. “In his deep ecstatic state Srila Gurudeva had completed in one day the twelve-day <i>parikrama</i> performed from Vrndavana to Govardhana.” Then Srila Gurudeva began to say “I must visit Dana Ghati, the festival at the bank of Surabhi-kunda, Radha-kunda, Syama-kunda and other pastime places” later on he said, “Today the <i>parikrama</i> is going to Nandagaon and Varsana. Then to Ter Kadamba, Uddhava-kyari and Uncagaon” so in one day Srila Gurudeva completed the eighteen-day <i>parikrama</i> normally performed from Govardhana.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I returned to Australia feeling very sad, deep in separation of my beloved Gurudeva, Srila Bhakti Narayan Maharaja Goswami.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva then went to Jagannatha Puri and at 3:00 am on December 29, 2010, he entered Sri Sri Radha-Ramana-Bihariji’s <i>Nishant-lila</i> (night pastimes) in the Lord’s own eternal abode, causing all devotees who had taken shelter at his lotus feet to become submerged in intense separation from him. Srila Gurudeva was taken to Navadvipa-dhama for his <i>samadhi</i> ceremony.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In 2015, I travelled to Navadvipa Dharma for <i>parikrama</i> and took <i>darshan</i> of Srila Gurudeva at his <i>samadhi</i> and an overwhelming sadness came over me and I wailed out of separation for Srila Gurudeva. I hired a driver and 4-wheel drive vehicle to take Uma didi and her servant Ranga devi didi, myself and god brother Madhumangala Das. I am again ever so grateful for the association of Uma didi during the <i>parikrama</i> and <i>harikatha,</i> sharing how Gurudeva used to do the <i>parikrama</i> in the old days when they had to walk. Listening to her stories of Gurudeva helped ease my separation feelings of Gurudeva. I bathed my worshipable deities Gaura-Nitai in the Ganges on Gaura Purnima and celebrated Gaura Purnima at the Navadvipa Temple. Uma didi and her party returned to Vrindavan after Navadvipa <i>parikrama</i> and Madhumangala Das and I went on to Jagganatha Puri to do <i>parikrama</i> with a book given to us by Chandra Mukhi didi. The highlight places were Sarvabauma Acarya’s temple where Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed his six handed form and at the Tota Gopinath temple where Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu entered Tota Gopinatha when he disappeared from this planet. The <i>pujari</i> came over to us and asked us about the Puri <i>parikrama</i> book we were reading and had a read himself. He shared that there was a lot of knowledge in the book and wanted us to return to have lunch at the temple and take <i>darshan</i> of the diety Tota Gopinatha.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva was definitely looking after us on this journey and I am so grateful for being able to gather <i>sukriti</i> and <i>samskaras</i> for my next lifetime. Another highlight place was at Haridasa Thakura's temple where we honored this saintly Vaisnava who was so loved by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I offer millions and millions of my humble and respectful <i>dandavat pranamas, </i>obeisances, time and time again unto the lotus feet of my beloved Srila Gurudeva for being in my life and that he remains in my heart lifetime after lifetime and remembers me always and continues to offer me <i>seva</i> and arrange lifetime after lifetime association with the <i>manjaris </i>serving Srimati Radhika and Sri Govinda and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Aspiring for the mercy and service of Srila Gurudeva and vaishnavas,</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Yamuna Dev Dasi</p> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/contact" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
