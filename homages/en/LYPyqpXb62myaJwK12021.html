jnananjana-salakaya<br>caksur unmilitam yena tasmai sri-gurave namah</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Dear Srila Bhaktivedenta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja,</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I offer my most humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> This offering is for your centennial celebration, 100 years of divine service. Just like my Srila Prabhupada, Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, you are still serving, giving and caring for all by your nectarean books, your sincere followers and your direct mercy.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> After my Srila Prabhupada left this world, I still served for many years within his mission but eventually felt that I was not able to access the incredible truths and deep deep experiences I once had and that I longed to again touch.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> At this point I want to stress I am not laying blame anywhere, others may have had completely different experiences, I am simply recounting my own.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So at a certain point, I prayed and cried to Srila Prabhupada, "Where is what you gave me, I am not able to find it anymore?" I cried daily and deeply and that is when you, Srila Narayana Gosvami Maharaja, somehow came to the very town I was living in, a few streets away in fact and gave evening classes.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I saw, to my surprise, that you also were "other worldly" as was my Srila Prabhupada but with quite a different personality. I was given some of your books and that was the beginning of my journey with you at my Srila Prabhupada's side.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> As soon as I read your books, everything Srila Prabhupada had said and all my earlier deep experiences fell into place and a treasure chest of wonders opened before me. Your books fitted 100% with my previous experiences which were to me amazing, but like pieces of an unmade jigsaw puzzle did not make a clear picture. On reading your books I was immediately transported into the divine depths of Srila Prabhupada's own books and the incredible depths of the inner feelings of Srila Prabhupada's heart.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Of course, it is impossible to truly touch on those depths of his heart but even to touch on a tiny fraction of a ray of those feelings is enough to purify and satisfy us for eternity.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> You have been the perfect <i>siksa-guru</i> for me, because <i>siksa-guru</i> deepens our relationship with our <i>diksa-guru</i>, and that is what you did. You always told me, "you are Swamiji's", and yes Srila Prabhupada is on the throne of my heart. I have never been able to, or wanted to, take him off there; but you are also now sitting on the side of that throne along with my Srila Prabhupada, just as your own Gurudeva, Sri Srimad Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Gosvami Maharaja would have our Srila Prabhupada sit on the same platform as himself when our Srila Prabhupada visited. And you will sit there in my heart as his dear friend always. I am so deeply grateful for my heart was hankering for the depth that is in your books.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> As a younger devotee I was very shy and very submissive, and in fact, in general I could not speak up for myself even if I wanted to or needed to. First week in the temple, the temple commander said, "You're a woman, you don't read, you just work hard", and told me to put down the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> I had in my hand. For the next 18 years in the <i>asrama</i> and 4 years as a householder, I never read even one book. Although I had actually read <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and Nectar of Devotion (a gift from the temple I initially visited) before I joined, and I also avidly went to the classes morning and evening because I loved to hear. But still there were many things I did not know or understand and I made many mistakes in my preaching to others and in my own practices. I did love serving both in the temple and on the streets and this absorption kept me in a determined and positive frame of mind with strong morning <i>sadhana</i> for many years.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So my dear <i>siksa-gurudeva</i>, some of the wonderful things I learned from you that I hadn't understood before put all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together when I met you and read your books. I also read my Srila Prabhupada's books which I hadn't read before and discovered so much depth, and indeed, the same things you were saying in your books were in Srila Prabhupada's books and purports, especially in Caitanya Caritamrita.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The first thing I came to understand was that Srila Prabhupada had an eternal form in <i>aprakata-vraja</i>. Sounds ridiculous to me now, but having not read and having a very simple mind, I had wondered how Srila Prabhupada could be in the spiritual world in an old body. I just knew I wanted to serve and return to the spiritual world; what that entailed or meant, or the process, I didn't understand at all. I just wanted to go there and serve Radha and Krsna.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Second thing, I had always understood that we had to be one-pointed in our bhakti and had always had an attraction for Radha and Krsna, so how did Lord Caitanya, (who all the devotees seemed to talk about all the time and very little directly about Radha and Krsna), fit in and still be one pointed? I was always too afraid to ask. In your <i>Manah-siksa</i> you approach this very point in question and answer form. "So how can we be one pointed; Radha and Krsna, and Caitanya Mahaprabhu, seems like two?" Answer: "Lord Caitanya is non-different to Radha and Krsna, just them in another amazing form and so we are still one pointed."</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Third, I learned the three internal reasons of Caitanya Mahaprabhu's appearance and indeed how He is non-different to Sri Sri Radha and Krsna and all the deep esoteric teachings of this subject matter which are eternally unlimited and ever expanding.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I also learned an incredibly important point, that, although Srila Prabhupada will always be on the throne of my heart because he saved me, he brought this incredible high teaching and presented it in such a way that somehow or other I was able to enter that divine path of spiritual revelation. He bent to the floor for us - I can never forget - but - there are also other pure devotees, serving their own given missions and also deserving of respect, love and appreciation. But who also are teaching in different ways and by their personal example. And most importantly, I learned that not everyone spoke against our Srila Prabhupada or misunderstood him.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Another very important thing I also learned from you Srila Maharaja, is how to reconcile the 'seeming' differences between the statements of pure devotees. Pure devotees speak on three levels: <i>apara-vicara</i>, <i>tattva-vicara</i> and <i>rasa-vicara</i>. According to our level we will hear or read things in different ways and notice certain statements and not others. Pure devotees are individuals even in the way they present things, but they do not disagree on <i>siddhanta</i> when understood properly.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Besides that you taught the difference between <i>vaidhi</i> and <i>raganuga-bhakti</i>. Until I met you I had no idea that by perfecting <i>vaidhi-bhakti</i> one goes to Vaikuntha, and that only <i>raganuga-bhakti</i> can take us to our goal of Vraja - but now I see that it is very clearly stated in Srila Prabhupada's <i>Caitanya-caritamrita</i> purports.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> You taught the meaning of greed. Srila Prabhupada also stated from scripture "the only price is greed". If a serious <i>sadhaka</i> having done many years of <i>seva</i> is not allowed to read further subject matter he will not be able to develop to deeper levels. Some may be fine with that. No problem, nothing should be false, but if someone is serious and genuinely has that aspiration and taste they should not be stopped from hearing that subject matter.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> For myself, I do not consider myself qualified for <i>raganuga-bhakti</i>, it may take me lifetimes to get to that level but what I can truly say is that I love hearing about it, I love reading about it, thinking about it. I know that's where I want to end up. Right from the beginning it is where I wanted to end up, but now I have more details. Without hearing about this subject matter there is an emptiness to my practices. This is all totally in line with Srila Prabhupada's purports and guidance in <i>Caitanya-caritamrita</i> of which books to read, and in line with your guidance also Srila Gurudeva.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I am not pretending to be something I am not, there are many more advanced than me on deeper levels but I am extremely grateful to have a head full and a heart full of divine aspirations as I traverse naturally along the path under the guidance of <i>sadhu</i>, <i>sastra</i> and guru.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I also understood from you Srila Maharaja more about <i>guru-tattva, baladeva-tattva, maya-tattva </i>etc and have a wonderful chart of <i>sakti-tattva</i> explaining <i>sandhini</i>, <i>samvit</i> and <i>hladini</i> along with <i>cit-sakti</i>, <i>jiva-sakti</i> and <i>maya-sakti</i>. This chart gives such an incredibly clear understanding of the interactions of the Lord's various saktis. Thanks to your disciple Sripad B.V. Tridandi Maharaja and his amazing <i>japa-retreats</i> where we learned so much. The information in this chart covers so much and applies to almost every page in <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> and <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> You also gave encouragement to read the books of our divine predecessor <i>acaryas</i>, their prayers and the beautiful pastimes of Radha and Krsna.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> There is so much you have given and I beg forgiveness for the many unintentional but numerous offenses I'm sure I made to you over the years due to my conditioned nature.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> My Srila Prabhupada was so incredibly expert how he gave Krsna consciousness to the world in such a way that all could come, some way or another, closer to the reality of their original selves. He tricked so many people and is still gathering masses of people by tricky means, who have no idea of their own welfare or of his spider's web gradually catching and entangling them in the web of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's loving network. He gave everything, especially in his <i>Caitanya-caritamrita</i>. You are also expert in your field and giving to all, complimenting and opening up our Srila Prabhupada's purports. I can only speak for myself, you have expanded my Srila Prabhupada's glories and shown me that he gave the world and all of us more than I had ever understood. I had seen the 'height of the mountain' Srila Prabhupada, but I did not understand the 'depth of the mountain' Srila Prabhupada.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The divine loving sentiments of Sri Sri Radha Krsna that Caitanya Mahaprabhu came and magnanimously distributed to the world, those sentiments were swelling and surging in Srila Prabhupada's heart at all times as many saw externally over the years when he could not contain his emotions. You, Srila Maharaja, allowed me to understand a small snippet of those inner churnings of Srila Prabhupada's heart that I previously had not understood. You, Srila Maharaja, helped me put together the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of my previous experiences and make a picture that made things much more clear. You, Srila Maharaja, were the one that Srila Prabhupada seemed to choose to send me to, for further understanding of the path of his teachings. Krsna and guru are in our heart, they understand us better than we understand ourselves, they sent me to you. They may have sent someone else to another pure devotee; some may be realizing by staying within Srila Prabhupada's mission as time goes on.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Pure devotees are not competitive or envious in a materialistic way. Whichever way an individual <i>sadhaka</i> is guided, as long as the <i>siddhanta</i> is correct, does not really matter. So much fighting and arguing for nothing. All are working together for the same goal, to get us out of the material nature and our misidentification and to understand our real natures as servant of Krsna, and ultimately for those fortunate souls it applies to, as <i>radha-dasyam</i>. Better to maturely discuss than fight. It is <i>maya's</i> trick - to divide and conquer.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Like flowers in the garland of <i>prema-nama</i>, you are all working together; unseen and unnoticed by some, misunderstood by others; but so selfless and fixed in the mission of our predecessor acharyas, you all tolerate the onslaughts of the confused living entities (and even sometimes from confused or new <i>sadhakas</i>), and relentlessly work for our freedom from the stringent grip of material nature.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> You, Srila Maharaja, gave me so many understandings. I am truly grateful for all you have given. I close my offering here. Offering my <i>dandavat pranamas</i> hundreds of times at the lotus feet of all our predecessor <i>acaryas</i>, my own Srila Prabhupada, and yourself Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana Goswami Maharaja. I am remembering the kindness you have shown me and writing this for your centennial. You sit by Srila Prabhupada who is on the throne of my heart, like two friends together, working together for the same ultimate goal and both showering your loving kindness upon all <i>jivas</i>, and especially the devotees.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> An afterthought, I could have told some sweet pastimes you were kind enough to engage me in but this offering is, I feel, your true gift both to me and to the world.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Aspiring to become a true servant of the servant of the servant,</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> A very fallen but deeply grateful soul,</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Yasasvini Dasi</p> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/contact" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
