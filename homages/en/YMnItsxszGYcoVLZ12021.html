Maharaja.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>How it all started?</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It was October 2012, I, for the first time, had a chance to hear Srimad Bhagavatam from an ISKCON devotee in my neighbour’s house in Chandigarh. This was during our short stint of three years in that city.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I was quite intrigued after listening to the <i>Katha</i>, as this definitely seemed more than just a story, which is usually narrated during <i>Bhagwat Katha</i>. As <i>sukriti </i>would have it, I started enquiring more about the subject. But this, unfortunately, could not continue for long because by mid-December my husband got transferred back to Mumbai.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> On settling back in Mumbai, I tried to connect myself to an ISKCON temple near me, but somehow, I was not satisfied, as my questions remained unanswered.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> For almost two years I was without any spiritual guidance and was literally yearning to find one. At last, I decided to contact prabhuji from whom I had heard Bhagwat in Chandigarh. I had a strong feeling that he had access to some book which the other ISKCON devotees did not. Being a lover of books myself, I thought that I would easily be able to gain knowledge by reading, and thus would find answers to my questions.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I finally called him up and requested him to share the name of the book, from which I can get ontological details. Prabhuji, who by that time had ( for some reason) left ISKCON, answered, in a rather harsh tone (do not know why) that in order to get the real ontological knowledge, one has to read a lot of books, not just one. He added that he doesn't think that I would be in a position to understand even one.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Listening to this statement of his, my ego was badly hurt. But, overpowered by my quest of spiritual knowledge, I insisted on sharing the list of the books. (While in my mind, I had literally taken a vow, that very moment, that I would surely read all of them now.)</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> He further added that it would be very difficult for me to even find the books. Later, however, on my persistence, he finally shared the names of around 12 books namely, Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita, Ujjwal Nilamani, Krishna-Karnamritam, Jaiva Dharma, Madhurya Kadambini, Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, Brihad Bhagwatamritam and others.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>My quest for books and hearing Srila Gurudeva’s name for the first time</b>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The challenge now was to find these books. I searched the internet and discovered that these, primarily, are available at Gaudiya Math, of which I had never heard before.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> My further dilemma was, which book would I start with? I had never even heard about them before. I managed to choose Jaiva Dharma, based on the reasoning that it was written by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who was relatively a recent acharya as compared to the other authors.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Finally, I found a Gaudiya Math in Bandra and went there. I got Jaiva Dharma, but to my dismay, it was in Bengali. I enquired, from the in-charge of the book shop, if I could get the same in Hindi or English. He informed me that I can get the same only in “Srila Narayana Gosvami Maharaja’s math” This was for the first time I had heard Srila Gurudeva’s name.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> On inquiring further about the books and the math, I learnt that Srila Gurudeva’s math is primarily in Mathura. With great reverence, prabhuji further added that Srila Gurudeva is a prolific writer and ‘The great Vaishnava’. I am sure my attention at that time was only on the great writer part of the statement.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>My first visit to Srila Gurudeva’s Vrindavana math (Sri Rupa Sanatana Gaudiya Math)</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Again, as <i>sukriti</i> would have it, I had a chance to visit Vrindavana that very year and I decided to visit Srila Gurudeva’s Vrindavana math to get the books. On reaching Vrindavana, the first item on my agenda, of course, was to visit Rupa Sanatana Gaudiya Math. Unfamiliar with the whereabouts of the place, and having poor navigation skills, after about an hour, I could manage to find the math. Every step towards its entrance increased my excitement.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> On entering the gate, I saw saffron-clad brahmachari (Sripad Parmeshwari Prabhu ji) taking morning class, surrounded by many brahmacharis and other devotees. Without losing a moment, I inquired about the way to the bookshop. However, the moment to get books had not yet arrived, for I was asked to wait till the morning discourses would get finished. Not having a choice, I chose to sit in the class, but I distinctly remember that I did not register anything that was taught or discussed in the class.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In fact, my eyes were busy rolling from the walls to the ceiling, trying to notice the architecture and the murals and paintings depicting Sri Radha-Krishna and Mahaprabhu’s pastimes.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Finally, the class got over and I was invited to the bookshop. Seeing so many books, my happiness knew no bounds, I bought some 15-20 of them. Shyama Sundara Prabhu, the book store in-charge then, told me about Srila Gurudeva, and in particular, he mentioned that I was very fortunate to have come all the way in search of these books. I took his words very casually and just smiled. Along with books he shared contact details of a Didi, through whom, sometime later, around 2016, I managed to come in contact with Sripad Ramchandra Prabhuji.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Reading the first book by Srila Gurudeva—Jaiva Dharma</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> After coming back from Vrindavana, I started reading the books, as decided I started with Jaiva Dharma. With every page that I read, my attraction towards Srila Gurudeva increased. Gurudeva had already started showering his mercy, I had Ramchandra Prabhuji, who helped me in understanding the fine points of <i>siddhanta</i>. Ramchandra Prabhu ji used to explain with great patience, compassion and with fantastic examples. Another person from whom I got a lot of help initially was Puja didi (Srila Gurudeva had mercifully made these arrangements).</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Along with clarification of philosophy, Sripad Ramchandra Prabhuji also used to describe Srila Gurudeva’s pastimes. The description was so vivid, captivating and straight from the heart, that I could literally visualise the narration. My respects for Srila Gurudeva further deepened.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Soon, by the mercy of Srila Gurudeva, I got initiated by Nitya Lila Pravishta Bhaktivedanta Tirtha Maharaja ji (One of the foremost and very dear disciple of Srila Gurudeva). He also used to narrate some very miraculous pastimes of Srila Gurudeva (who technically was my Param Gurudeva now).</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Guru Maharaja's love, dedication towards Srila Gurudeva was very inspiring.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>What I learnt about Gurudeva from Vaishnavas</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> On listening to the various pastimes of Srila Gurudeva from Vaishnavas, I learnt how compassionate, disciplined and dauntless a preacher Srila Gurudeva was. He was an ideal disciple and an ideal spiritual master. He was ‘The Great Vaishnava’, and no wonder he was given the title of ‘Yugaacharya’.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I further learnt that he is Srimati Radha Rani's favourite manjari, Ramana manjari, (hence the installation of the deities of Sri Radha-Ramana-Vihariji) and out of causeless mercy had descended in this world from the transcendental abode, just to deliver jivas like me.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Srila Gurudeva’s pastimes are so very captivating.</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Listening to Srila Gurudeva’s pastimes is mesmerizing. One gets truly inspired and energized.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Be it the pastimes related to his initial days of hardships, while establishing Mathura Math and preaching in Mathura. or his love for Vrajwasis, be it his in-depth nectarine Krishna <i>katha</i>, or his clarification on Vrajendranandan Krishna and Devaki Nandana Krishna ( I am sure most of us did not know, before Srila Gurudeva’s books or lectures, that Yashoda Maiya had delivered twins—a baby boy-Krishna and a baby girl-Yoga Maya). Be it the pastimes about his love and dedication for his spiritual master (Srila Bhakti Prajnan Keshav Gosvami Maharaja) or his godbrothers (especially Srila Vaman Gosvami Maharaja and Srila Trivikram Gosvami Maharaja). He had love for all without any biases. He never differentiated between his disciples and the disciples of his godbrothers. He was equally affectionate towards them.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In fact, he considered the followers of Gaudiya Sampradaya as one big family, we all know how he had saved the existence of ISKCON once.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> He was a perfectionist at everything, be it organising the <i>Kartik Parikrama</i> for approximately 60 long years or the organising of the <i>Vidwat sabha </i>for three days for glorifying Srila Rupa Goswami Pada on his <i>tithi</i>- just to make us realise what Mahaprabhu actually wanted to give through Rupa Goswami. And, most importantly, how we can become Rupanaga in a real sense.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Srila Gurudeva’s Pure Bhakti preaching far and wide and his love for publishing books.</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Talking about his relentless preaching across the globe, he taught millions what ‘Pure Bhakti’ actually is.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In his 24x7 packed schedule, he managed to write and publish books, which is simply amazing!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It’s because of his constant endeavours that today so many <i>Gaudiya Granthas</i> are available in Hindi, which otherwise were only available in Bengali or Sanskrit. He himself, by translating them in Hindi blessed millions. In fact, it's through his books that I got attracted initially, and I am sure these books continue to spell their magic.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Srila Gurudeva’s capacity to win one and all.</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva’s personality would simply win all. His sweet smile, radiant face, energetic voice and nectarine words have been winning hearts. His simple way of making people understand the intricacies of both <i>Rasa</i> and <i>Tattva</i> in his lectures was just amazing.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> His lectures! O! What to say about them? A treasure house!!! Listening to his lectures and not noticing words like' Radha-dasyam' or '<i>hamari svamini</i> Srimati Radhika' is just not possible.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Yes, he is the one who created a distinct identity for all his followers. How? Talk to any <i>sadhaka</i> about his aim and if the answer is ‘Radha-dasyam' be sure he/she belongs to Srila Gurudeva.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In fact, he started with setting the aim of a <i>sadhaka</i>, which I am sure many otherwise would take lifetimes to set, what to say of achieving it.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>The manifestation of Srila Gurudeva’s mercy on me.</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It's his mercy through his books, his disciples and lectures that such a wretched being, like me, has got to know the life’s aim (nonetheless, I always regret not having met him while he performed his manifest pastimes).</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In fact, he was merciful enough to engage me in a <i>seva</i> (translation of Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita in English) through Sripad Gokulchandra Prabhuji (on the recommendation of Sripad Ramchandra Prabhuji)</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Sripad Gokulchandra Prabhuji, who is a very dear disciple of Srila Gurudeva, was instructed by Srila Gurudeva himself to translate and publish Sri Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita in Hindi (along with commentaries of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, and Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Sarasawati Thakur Prabhupada), which he has been doing with full dedication.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I distinctly remember that when Prabhuji offered me to do this seva, I was really hesitant, as I lacked prior experience. But, I was assured that any impediment and Srila Gurudeva himself will come to my rescue, it's just that I have to pray to him for his mercy.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Well! I do vouch for the same now. I have experienced it many times. Whenever I get stuck, trying to figure out the real meaning of some text (especially with <i>Anubhashya</i> of Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Prabhupada or with excerpts from Srila Jiva Goswami Pada’s <i>Sandharbas</i>), I silently pray to Srila Gurudeva for help and very soon by his mercy, I generally get to read or hear about that topic in his or other senior Vaishnavas’ lectures, else Sripad Gokulchandra Prabhuji mercifully comes to my rescue.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I sincerely pray to Srila Gurudeva’s lotus feet that this English translation gets completed by the end of January ‘21, so that it can be offered to him on his Centennial.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Srila Gurudeva, please do pay heed to my prayers.</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva! I wish to say that neither am I adept in ontology or scriptures nor am I confident of my efforts. Brimming with <i>anarthas</i>, a householder, with my <i>sadhana</i> endeavours, when I look at the goal of ‘Radha-dasyam', I get worried, really worried, how will that be ever possible for me? I can't even do <i>Harinam</i> properly.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> But then, your encouraging words like - ‘never leave <i>Harinam</i>’, or ‘<i>utsah nischyat dhariyat’</i>, or ‘even if you fall in the hellish planets I will pull you out”, gives me hope and encouragement to keep going, because I have full faith in your words.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The nectarian lectures of yours, instructing how to do bhajan and describing sweet pastimes of Sri Sri Radha and Krishna instils confidence and courage that this is the right path, and one day in some lifetime, I will achieve my aim. All I have to do is keep going because you are and will be there with me always. I keep reminding myself of your words-" I am closer to you than the air you breathe".</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> With folded hands I just want to state, you definitely are ‘<i>Radhikaye priyatamane</i>’, adept in narrating <i>Krishna Katha</i> and elaborating the sweet pastimes of the divine couple. You are truly munificent.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So, please bless me with the eternal remembrance of your lotus feet.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Srila Gurudeva ki jai! Jai ! Jai!</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Srila Tirtha Maharaja ji ki jai!</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Samast Vaishnava Vrind ki jai !</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Priyanka Amit Kumar<br>(Disciple of Sripad B.V.
