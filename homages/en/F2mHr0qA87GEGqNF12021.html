text-2xl font-semibold"> United Kingdom, Buxton </h2> <div class="mt-8 xl:px-8"> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I offer my humble <i>dandavat pranams</i> to the lotus feet of my dearmost Srila Gurudeva, nitya-lila-pravista om vishnupad astottara-sata Sri Srimad Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja. I offer my humble dandavat pranams to all the devotees of Sri Gauranga Mahaprabhu’s family, past, present and future.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> By their mercy, I am trying to glorify my Gurudeva, hoping to deepen my connection to him and his family of devotees.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I am my gurudeva’s daughter! Out in the world, mostly, I keep this hidden. Certainly, I cannot represent him. But I have this conception nonetheless, and it brings a big smile to my heart. Srila Gurudeva gave us the feeling that ‘Gurudeva is mine’. So, although my consciousness is so much egotistical – with the conception that ‘this’ and ‘that’ is mine – Srila Gurudeva gave that idea, the highest idea, that we will give up these designations and have only one – that Srimati Radhika is ours, that <i>guru sakhi</i> is ours, and we will serve there like that. He gave that jewel to be uncovered.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I find it so astonishing that Gurudeva gave some idea of that, some impression of that, and some impression of the pastimes and pastime places where that will happen. It really is like the beggar who feels that, ‘I will marry Princess Di’. I remember Gurudeva talking about that; he gave that hope, that aspiration – to have a greed like that – even to someone who knows nothing of who he is, nothing of <i>siddanta</i>, who is naturally inclined to ignorant and offensive behaviour. But this disqualification was nothing to Gurudeva. He communicated with my soul, and thereby gave me hope.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I know that when I met Srila Gurudeva, there were many devotees taking shelter of him who were ready to hear what he gave. They had been serving in ISKCON for so many years, or they had been brought up as devotees. They already had some understanding of our philosophy. When Srila Gurudeva taught them about our highest goal, about why Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu came, Krishna’s internal reasons, and this <i>sva bhakti sriyam</i> that He came to distribute, now, years later, I am beginning to realize how much these devotees must have been drinking this nectar. What to speak of the pastimes he told! They were ready to hear it and they were ready to give their life, their heart and soul, to him. And to serve him. I am falling at their feet and begging that they now teach me too.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In contrast, I came from nowhere. I just got caught up in the tsunami! But from top to bottom, he captured hearts and put them in his pocket. And he certainly did that to me. It was so intimate.<br><br>I was lucky enough to meet Srila Gurudeva at a time when for a few years, he was still going out on <i>parikrama</i>, and I was thrown into a world that I didn’t understand at all. One minute I was in a nightclub, the next, on <i>parikrama </i>in Vrndavana! But, like I said, he captured my heart in such an intimate way; and it’s this intimacy, and my astonishment at it, that I want to share a bit of, as an offering to Srila Gurudeva. I am sure you all have so many memories like this, so it is my humble hope that, by sharing mine, and my wonder at how beautiful this was, that it will be <i>uddipana</i> for you also.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Intimate operations that claimed our eternal relationship </b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The first time I saw him – he was floating. He was like that on <i>parikrama </i>also. Particularly, I remember Govardhan <i>parikrama</i>, and how he would glide along with us all running after him. But I digress. The first <i>darshan</i> I had with him, when he turned his glance on me, it was like taking a breath for the very first time; like I’d been under water all my life but hadn’t known it. The relief was so intense, I burst into tears. At that moment Gurudeva became father. I couldn’t wait to see him again.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> You will all have had the experience of a ‘look’ from Gurudeva – how special that was, how a world of meaning was contained in a look. My first experience of this was when I had arrived in Mathura for the first time. Gurudeva had been away and the devotees were excitedly waiting for him to return. As Gurudeva entered the math, from 50 metres away I got that look. I wasn’t sure it had really happened at the time. I was so shocked. With that one look, Gurudeva acknowledged that I had come home to him. There was no mistaking the meaning, or the feeling it gave me.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I wasn’t someone who could be really open with Gurudeva. I had awe for him. And I didn’t understand, will never understand, the depth and sincerity of his love. I had a lot of fear. But several times, Gurudeva let me know that he saw through all my walls, all my dishonesty, all my ‘yucky stuff’, but still accepted me. The first was when I asked him for <i>harinama</i>. I asked, not because I had any idea of what I was asking for, but because I just wanted whatever he was giving. Again, that look. But this time it was so heavy. He turned to me and, with a gravity and power that made me cringe, he said, ‘Do you know what is <i>harinama</i>? It is not a toy!’ I wanted the ground to swallow me up. I knew he’d seen all my duplicity, my people pleasing, my desire to be thought well of, silly little girl that I am! When he turned to someone else, I paid my obeisances and ran from the room. I ran to the top of Sri Rupa Sanatana matha, tears streaming down my face. I couldn’t remember the code to the lock on our room, so I just stood outside, first crying, then laughing. What is amazing to me is that I wasn’t just crying because I’d been found out, or any other emotion I felt. Beyond this, Gurudeva had let me know, in that instance, that I was ‘seen’ and accepted. Like a father, he had chastised me, he had smashed my pride and revealed the imposter. But I was <i>his</i> to chastise, and again, the relief was overwhelming.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> These moments were operations on my heart. Sometimes it was painful, but they were so filled with love.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Parikrama</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The other day, I was listening to a class that Srila Gurudeva had given in Mathura in 1992, a whole 5 years before I met him. A particular remembrance of a pastime place and my time there with Gurudeva came to me, and it’s hard to describe the effect it had. Awe, that I had heard his <i>hari-katha</i>, and a glimmer of understanding that I had been in the company of devotees who were relishing it, diving deep into it. I know I am very far from that, but yet somehow, I also know that some deep impressions were made on my heart at that time, such that they grow and expand. They are living. In addition, Srila Gurudeva imprinted on me that my goal is to do <i>bhajan</i> in these beautiful places and eventually enter into <i>asta-kaliya lila</i>, realizing my transcendental form as a <i>dasi</i> of Srimati Radhika! Words fail me at this point. I want to laugh and cry!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I know I cannot fathom the wealth of those moments with Srila Gurudeva on <i>parikrama</i> in the holy <i>dhama</i>. I’d get a look or some other interaction, or just by virtue of being there with him - on the banks of the Yamuna, at the foot of Giriraja, at Ter Kadamba, at Vamsi-vata and Kaliya-hrada, at Varsana, at Radha-kunda – he gave everything in seed form. Somehow, in my heart, an impression was made, that made me feel like, ‘Giriraja is mine; Yamuna is mine’. Sometimes, because I’m so covered, distracted by my desires and my mind’s wanderings, and my life situation is ‘so bad’, I feel like maybe I’ve lost those moments. But then sometimes I’m chanting and they come back to me, or even the mood of those moments, and again I’m astonished that Srila Gurudeva was so generous as to give those jewels.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I also want to mention how I am grateful for the <i>astakams</i> we sang, and the verses that Srila Gurudeva and other devotees repeated and repeated, so that, although I am fool number one, yet I can recite some of these verses and songs, which I know contain so much power. I think if I had not spent those years going to Kartika, I would never have been able to remember those powerful mantras.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Reciprocation, Caring and Compassion</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Everything Srila Gurudeva did was ‘out of this world’ and timeless, and in his association I was brought to a childlike place in myself – I guess this was because he genuinely cared, so I felt safe. I remember falling asleep at night – having had his association, his <i>hari-katha</i>, having run along behind him on <i>parikrama</i> – and feeling safe for the first time in my life, like I was held in the lap of my mother. One year, having just arrived in Modi bhavan, putting up our mosquito nets, Hari Priya and I looked up and saw Gurudeva looking around, having just stepped out of his room. He saw us and beckoned to us. We jumped up and ran like little children to him. He wanted to know if we had found a place to sleep, if all the devotees had enough space. I realised he was concerned, his <i>parikrama</i> party having grown, and told him that Vrnda didi had arranged everything very well. He looked pacified and said something about how competent Vrnda didi was, I can’t remember his exact words. But I thought it was beautiful that he was so concerned for us like that.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Sometimes, on <i>parikrama</i>, Srila Gurudeva would share a <i>chapatti </i>or some other <i>prasadam </i>with us. The first year I went for Kartik, we went to Srila Sanatan Gosvami’s <i>samadhi</i>. I prayed very hard when I put my head in the dust there. Srila Gurudeva had told us to pray only for Radha <i>dasyam</i>, and as he had given me the name Lavanga, I thought to myself, ‘Srila Sanatana Gosvami will surely help me’. When we got back to Rupa Sanatana matha, Srila Gurudeva was on the landing near his room, distributing what I later learned was a <i>chapatti </i>from Srila Sanatana Gosvami’s <i>samadhi</i>. He saw me and called me over to give me a little bit. In this way, he let me know that he knew how hard I had tried to pray.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> A few years later, I had been struggling very much to be a devotee in the West. To be frank, I was a mess, and so having travelled to Mathura for Kartika, I was nervous to meet Srila Gurudeva. However, I also knew that I am his daughter, so there was no other option than to simply run and throw myself on his mercy. I was dirty from the train ride from Delhi, and feeling even more dirty in my heart. Srila Gurudeva had been giving <i>darshan</i> on the roof of Sri Keshavaji Gaudiya Matha, and was just about to go in his room. I ran up to him and said ‘I’m here Gurudeva!’ He didn’t say much, but he motioned to me to follow him into his room. I was there alone with him. I can’t remember much conversation, I think he just asked me if I was okay. Of course, I was always okay once I had his loving glance. Mostly, I just remember how he reached over and got some Jaganatha <i>prasadam </i>from a box and gave it to me. Then he gave me the box and indicated I should put it under his bed. The exchange was so calming and intimate, like a family member. And I felt once again, how simple this bhakti process can be – just take <i>prasadam </i>with faith!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I don’t know how, but every exchange with Srila Gurudeva, is like a mine of gems, ‘transcendental mood gems’! I just hope that in one lifetime, I can stop treating it like a ‘<i>rasagula’</i> and start following him properly, with gratitude and faith. I cannot glorify my Gurudeva. I have no notion of how great he is really. In fact, whenever I glimpse something of his glory, either through reading his books or listening to <i>hari-katha</i> and hearing about his glories from those devotees who know him and serve him, I feel like I’ve got vertigo and my logical mind can’t understand how I came into contact with him. I hope that in this <i>puspanjali</i>, that I have got across something of my astonishment at this. And I pray for the mercy of the vaisnavas that I can stay connected. Please forgive my offences, and keep me at your lotus feet.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Here is a lovely quote from Srila Bhakti Raksaka Sridhar Gosvami Maharaja.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> “We are in the ocean of faith and the devotees are the essential agents. Each helps the other. We are much relieved from the fatigue and trials of a long journey if we have a companion or the association of a group. Similarly, in this ocean, if we obtain the help of devotees of similar nature to ours, that will be most conducive.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So dearest Gurudeva, I am begging that you please connect me with your beautiful family of devotees, and under their guidance, draw me close to your lotus feet, in this and every life.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Jaya Srila Gurudeva!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Your dear daughter</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Lavanga Lata Dasi (UK)</p> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/contact" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
