pravishta om visnupada paramahamsa</i> Sri Srimad Bhaktivedanta Narayana Goswami Maharaja.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> My Оffering</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> A conditioned soul like me is unable to realize the greatness and glory of a pure devotee. But if it is fortunate enough to hear glorification addressed to him from the lips of another pure devotee who is close to him in mood, then some kind of realization may come to it. I remember when I was in ISKCON everyone glorified Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj primarily for spreading Krishna Consciousness all over the world in just a few years. But Srila Gurudeva glorified Srila Swami Maharaj in a completely different way in the book "My Siksa-guru and Priya-bandhu." According to him, the true greatness of Srila Swami Maharaj lies in the fact that he is an eternal resident of Vraja, especially Giriraj Govardhan. That is why in his last days he asked to be taken there in a cart pulled by bulls. But his disciples did not understand the desire of his heart and therefore did not fulfill his request. However, by some incomprehensible fortune, we had the opportunity to hear so much about the glories of Srila Swami Maharaja and other <i>acaryas</i> from the lips of our Srila Gurudeva. Similarly, if we hear about Srila Gurudeva from other exalted Vaishnavas, we will to some extent be able to understand his real glories.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>The best glorification. </b>As we know from the <i>sastras</i> , the guru contains two <i>tattvas</i> - <i>akhanda-guru tattva</i> and <i>rasa-tattva</i> , and, accordingly, he is the representative of two Personalities: Sri Nityananda Prabhu and Srimati Radharani. Therefore, Srila Gurudeva can also be glorified from these two points of view. However, each disciple perceives his guru primarily based on his <i>adhikara.</i> Many times we have heard from senior devotees that Srila Gurudeva is the intimate maidservant of Srimati Radharani. However, I don't have any practical implementation for this. It is far more appropriate for me to glorify Srila Gurudeva as he is the true follower of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and the ideal representative of our <i>guru-parampara</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Many times we have heard <i>harikatha</i> from the lips of Gurudeva, in which he glorified such great acaryas such as Srila Rupa Gosvami, Srila Visvanatha Cakravatri Thakura, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, and very deeply and in detail revealed the essence of their teachings. From this we can conclude that his inner mood is no different from their mood. Therefore, I think that Srila Gurudeva can be best glorified by saying that he is absolutely non-different from our <i>guru-parampara</i> and he is its ideal representative. The message that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu bestowed on the souls of the age of Kali and which was carefully transmitted from one acarya to another, fully lives in the heart of Srila Gurudeva. This is why his preaching is so successful and attracts so many people around the world. His strength is primarily in his indissoluble unity with all other true representatives of our <i>guru-parampara</i>. This unity comes from Sri Baladeva Prabhu, Who is the one and undivided principle of <i>akhanda-guru-tattva.</i> Due to his crystal purity, Srila Gurudeva is an ideal transmitting medium through which spiritual knowledge is distributed in an undistorted form throughout the world. There are so many opinions, teachings and all kinds of beliefs in this world. We cannot understand how fortunate we are that, by the grace of Srila Gurudeva, we have gained access to the original, undistorted and most exalted spiritual knowledge. As this knowledge blossoms in our hearts, our understanding of the greatness and glory of Srila Gurudeva will grow with it. This process is endless, just like Krishna Himself.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>His mission. </b>To show the inseparable unity of my Srila Gurudeva with the <i>acaryas of the</i> past, I would like to remind the four instructions that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu gave to the Six Goswamis:<br><br> 1) to discover the places of Sri Krishna's pastimes;<br> 2) to install Krishna Deities everywhere;<br> 3) to write books about <i>bhakti</i>;<br> 4) to establish the principles of Vaishnava etiquette.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> One can see that the life of Srila Gurudeva is a wonderful example of following these four instructions of Mahaprabhu, and therefore he is worthy of no less glorification than the Six Goswamis of Vrindavan.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 1) In fact, he was rediscovering places of Krishna's pastimes, the glory of which was partially lost (or covered up) by the wrong <i>siddhanta</i> . For example, earlier local <i>brahmanas</i> in Gokula claimed that Krishna was born in Mathura. But Srila Gurudeva, based on the <i>sastras</i>, was able to convince them, and now they with the same enthusiasm inform all the pilgrims that Krishna was born in Gokula. Srila Gurudeva also defended the concept of <i>parakiya-vada</i>. Previously, local <i>brahmanas</i> of Bhandirvana were convinced that Radha and Krishna were spouses and that Their wedding ceremony took place in this place. But Srila Gurudeva was able to convince them, proving that there was a <i>gandharva-vivaha</i>, a joke wedding, so the <i>parakiya</i> mood in the relationship between Radha and Krishna was not disturbed.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva also reconstructed and maintained many places in Vraja, such as Uddhava-kyari, Ter-kadamba, Brahma-kundu and others. Srila Gurudeva was awarded with the title of Yuga-acarya for his outstanding service to the <i>Dhama</i> in 2003 by the most famous representatives of Vraja. Many of us remember this grand ceremony that took place in Uncha-gaon during the Kartik month.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 2) He installed Deities of Sri Gauranga Mahaprabhu, Sri Sri Radha-Vinoda-bihari ji, Sri Sri Radha-Govinda ji and others all over the world, wherever he came to preach. He also returned the Deity of Vrinda Devi back to Vrindavan, installing her <i>murti</i> in the Rupa-Sanatana Gaudiya Math, and revealed the secret <i>tattva</i> about the spiritual form of Giriraj Govardhan, who is now worshiped in some of our Mathas as Girirani Maharani.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 3) He wrote or translated many books from Sanskrit and Bengali into Hindi, provided commentary on many of them, and also inspired his disciples to translate them into all languages ​​of the world. His literary heritage continues to inspire many devotees, including those from other Mathas and spiritual organizations.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> 4) By his ideal example, he taught everyone Vaishnava etiquette. He constantly told his disciples not to criticize others and always show respect to everyone and especially to Vaishnavs according to their spiritual level. He made it clear to everyone that all Vaisnavas are members of the same family, the family of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> This is the best evidence that Srila Gurudeva's mission is non-different from the mission of the Six Goswamis and entire <i>guru-parampara</i>, and therefore he is its ideal representative.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>His main quality. </b>Despite the fact that all the <i>acaryas </i>in our line are non-different, at the same time each of them has some special qualities. A diamond is so attractive because it has many facets and each facet sparkles in the sun in a special way. Therefore, if the personality traits of Srila Gurudeva are not glorified, glorification will be incomplete.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> His <i>pranama-mantra</i> contains the words <i>audarya</i> and <i>madhurya</i> — compassion and sweetness. Both of these qualities were fully manifested in himself, as well as in his <i>hari-katha</i>. Some people did not understand or even condemn him for how openly he discussed in public very inmost topics. This point requires a deep explanation. Srila Gurudeva is able to see the hearts of his listeners and chooses topics that correspond to the spiritual level of the audience. However, if he speaks on elevated topics, it does not mean that only advanced devotees are gathered in the auditorium. Srila Gurudeva has the unique ability to talk about Krishna in such a way that everyone present will benefit, regardless of their spiritual level. Often Gurudeva said during a lecture: "I am telling you such elevated things, but only two or four people can understand me here." This means that there are only a few devotees in the audience who are really advanced in <i>bhakti</i>. It is they who will <i>benefit</i> most from such <i>hari-katha</i> in the form of deep <i>samskaras</i>, impressions in the heart. But all other listeners will also receive benefit in the form of <i>sukrti</i> or spiritual <i>samskaras</i>, depending on their spiritual level. Later, this <i>sukrti</i> will bear fruit in the form of another portion of <i>hari-katha</i>, the <i>samskaras </i>will increase, and the devotee will have more taste in hearing the narratives of the pastimes of Sri Sri Radha-Krishna, and his <i>sambandha</i> will grow steadily. Many times Gurudeva said, "If I do not discuss these elevated topics, very soon it will be forgotten and will be forever lost to this world." For those who have not yet reached the heights of <i>bhakti</i>, his <i>hari-katha</i> is a huge reserve for the future, an incentive for spiritual development. Therefore, he can undoubtedly be called <i>prayojana-acarya</i>, the keeper of knowledge about the ultimate goal of spiritual practice.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Behavior of a pure devotee. </b>One of the qualities of a true <i>sadhu</i> is that he does not need anything in this world, because he already has everything. Sri Sri Radha-Krishna lives in his heart. All Vraja is in it along with its eternal inhabitants, as well as all other <i>dhamas</i>. There is absolutely nothing in the material world that can be of any value to a pure devotee. No wealth of this world can attract him. Guru is absolutely indifferent to all this. Any of our material qualities, abilities, labor skills and perfection have no meaning for him. Therefore, we can offer absolutely nothing to him. But at the same time, Srila Gurudeva needs a lot from us. And we are not able to give it to him right away, no matter how much we want. But he is very eager to get it. What does he want? The same thing that young gopis want when they come to the banks of Kusum-sarovara. They want to collect a bunch of charming flowers, from which they will weave a fragrant garland and offer it to Krishna. And this entire material world is like a small lawn on the banks of the Kusum-sarovara. From time to time, great personalities, eternal associates of the Lord, come here from the spiritual world to pick up a bouquet of flowers — our hearts, weave a beautiful garland and offer it to the lotus feet of the Divine Couple. Srila Gurudeva wants to take possession of our heart to offer it to Krishna. He is very skillful in this, because he had appeared in this world in <i>Amavasya</i>. Being born in <i>Amavasya </i>is believed to be inauspicious. Many thieves and robbers are born at this particular time. But as for Krishna and His eternal associates, all qualities, both good and bad, are absolutely spiritual. The guru knows perfectly how to deceive us and steal our heart. I remember how he once confessed at his class: “Krishna is the best deceiver. And I also know some tricks." With his sweet <i>hari-katha</i>, his gentle association, his ideal character and impeccable demeanor, he easily captured our hearts. It can only be done by one who has Krishna in his heart. As we know, Krishna is the most skillful snatcher of hearts.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>He is the incarnation of Sri Nityananda Prabhu's </b><b>mercy</b><b>. </b>We have heard many times how Sri Nityananda Prabhu, following the order of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, preached the glories of the holy name. He knocked on every door and asked everyone to chant the holy name. If the door slammed shut in front of Him, He jumped through the window. He was literally distraught with the mood of <i>audarya</i> and <i>madhurya</i> . And the mood of our Srila Gurudeva is the same, it is no different from the mood of the <i>akhanda guru tattva</i>, Sri Nityananda Prabhu.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> There are many examples of how the mood of <i>Audarya</i> and <i>Madhurya</i> manifested itself in the actions of Srila Gurudeva. One day devotees gathered in Mathura at Keshavaji Gaudiya Math to listen to <i>hari-katha </i>from the lotus lips of Srila Gurudeva. But Gurudeva went somewhere. More than two hundred devotees were waiting for him, singing kirtans. More than two hours had passed before Gurudeva returned. It became known that Gurudeva went to someone's wedding. Probably, some doubts crept in: “How is this so? So many devotees were there, and Gurudeva went to the wedding of ordinary persons! " Gurudeva sensed this mood in the air and said, “You have already come to me. But these people are not yet there, so I myself went to them, taking advantage of the opportunity that fell to me.” I remember another incident. When Srila Gurudeva came to Moscow for the festival, Ashutosha prabhu met him and brought him by car to his apartment. Once Ashutosha prabhu suggested to Srila Gurudeva: "Come on, I will show you Moscow." And Srila Gurudeva willingly agreed. They drove around Moscow for a long time, somewhere along the way, they stopped and got out of the car. A beggar was sitting nearby and Srila Gurudeva gave him a small donation. One can see how Gurudeva uses every opportunity to bestow his mercy, sometimes even in the form of a small donation. In fact, we are not serving Gurudeva, but Gurudeva is serving us. For this he left his <i>bhajan</i> in Vrindavan and traveled thousands of miles to shower his mercy on conditioned souls.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It is always very painful for Srila Gurudeva to see when someone gives up spiritual practice. Once, many years ago, at Devananda Gaudiya Matha in Navadvipa, they wanted to expel a senior devotee whose behavior did not correspond to his status. But Srila Gurudeva was vigorously against it. He even said that he would leave Gaudiya Vedanta Samiti if they did so. He was so determined to save this devotee. He explained his mood in the following way: “For hundreds of lifetimes this <i>jiva </i>has come to attain <i>sadhu-sanga</i>. But if you kick him out of the temple, it can be the end of his entire spiritual life." From this example you can see how painful it is for Gurudeva when someone leaves the path of <i>bhakti</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Instead of an epilogue. </b>When a husband dies in a family, a chaste wife who has served him faithfully all her life simply does not know why she should live on. Likewise, when a guru leaves this world, a genuine disciple no longer sees the point in maintaining his life. But unlike the example of the deceased husband, Sri Guru is not an ordinary person. A disciple can serve not only his body, but his mission and his instructions. However, if we do not fully understand what his mission is and do not follow his instructions, our life becomes truly useless. What to do? The age-old question ...</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>yogyata-vichare, kichhu nahi pai,<br> tomara karuna sara<br> karuna na hoyle, kandiya kandiya,<br> prana na rakhibo ara</i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> “Looking into my heart, I do not find any good qualities there, so apart from your grace I have nothing to hope for.
