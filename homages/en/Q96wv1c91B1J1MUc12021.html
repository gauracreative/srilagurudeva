<b>Puspanjali at the lotus feet of our beloved Gurudeva, om visnupada astottara-sata Sri Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja.</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> How can we glorify a personality like Sri Gurudeva? In an effort to purify ourselves we will make an attempt, hoping that all Vaisnavas will forgive our offences and be compassionate upon these fallen <i>baddha-jivas</i>, full of <i>anarthas</i> and faults.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> We will try to recall some memories and events that we were most fortunate to have with Sri Gurudeva. With the object to show how merciful Sri Gurudeva was with this materialistic person and also to the hundreds of people that he came across in our presence that we have witnessed in Australia and Fiji.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> How unfortunate we are that during his physical presence we did not recognise our good fortune, and so did not surrender to him as much as we could have, and to the level that he expected of us. And now we are feeling his absence.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Oh Gurudeva, when will we develop the attraction for you and the Holy name and look away from the attractions of the worldly pleasures.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><b>How we met Sri Gurudeva</b></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In September 1996, we planned a trip to India. We were visiting India because we had heard from many <i>sadhus</i> that we needed a bonafide guru to progress in our spiritual path, and we hoped to find someone. We visited holy places in Vrndavana, Mathura, Haridwara and Rishikesh hoping to meet a guru that would attract us. However we came back to Brisbane unsuccessfully. Then in December 1997, we received a call from Kanti prabhu in Fiji that a <i>sadhu</i> was in Murwillumbah and needed somewhere to rest in Brisbane for a day before flying to Nadi. I was the vice president of our community organization and we had decided to host one evening program, so I got the opportunity to organise the <i>harikatha</i> in a school hall. We decided to go to Murwillumbah to meet this <i>sadhu</i> to invite him to Brisbane. I remember calling Vraja-vallabha prabhu asking for directions and timing of the program which was at his place. When my wife and I arrived in Murwillumbah, it was early afternoon and raining. We saw people were lining up to meet this <i>sadhu</i> in his cottage, which was set in a lush green environment with a stream running beside it. A beautiful <i>kirtana</i> was playing in a barn where the <i>katha</i> and the program was going to take place. Everything was nicely decorated with fresh flora and fauna and a wonderful <i>vyasa-asana</i> was set up. At this stage rain was just drizzling and the environment was beautiful. We could not help noticing that we were the only Indians amongst the hundreds of western devotees. As we were standing there lost, a devotee (Devendra prabhu) asked us where we were from and other details. He immediately took us to Srila Gurudeva’s room, bypassing other devotees. When we entered the cottage we saw Gurudeva sitting in a cane chair surrounded by other devotees. We were allowed a place to sit in front of Gurudeva and he started speaking to us in Hindi. When I saw in his eyes, I was bit nervous and astonished as he was speaking to us with direct eye contact. His voice was soft and very soothing. He asked us where we were from and our background. Karuna immediately requested to visit our home and have <i>prasad</i> there. Gurudeva asked, “ Who will cook? Will you cook?” Karuna said, “Yes, I will cook.” Madhava Maharaja, at that time Navina-krsna <i>brahmacari</i>, was a little surprised that Gurudeva accepted the invitation, since he was the only person cooking for Gurudeva at that time. Gurudeva asked us if we were vegetarian and if we were taking onion and garlic. We told him that we were vegetarian but taking onion and garlic. He asked us to throw away all onion and garlic upon reaching home and do not bring any again.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Gurudeva gave us two books that day, Manah Siksa and Updesamrta, which he signed. He asked us to stay back for <i>harikatha</i> and take <i>prasad</i> before leaving. Sripad Madhava Maharaja told us that Gurudeva and party will come very early in the morning. About nine people were travelling with Gurudeva. Some of the devotees who were with Gurudeva suggested that we should ask Gurudeva to give us <i>harinama</i>. We thought about it. We had gone to India to look for a bonafide guru about 6 months back and here a guru has come at our doorstep, so we thought this was meant to be. We approached Gurudeva for <i>harinama</i> in the afternoon before he left for program. He told us that you should first study me (<i>mujhe pahile parakh lo</i>) for a year and then accept initiation. We did not pursue any further. Maybe he was testing us.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In the evening program at the school hall he spoke about why he has come to Australia. He did not want anything from us but only came to give this wealth of Krishna prema. After the program he called us and gave us <i>harinama-mala</i> and put <i>kanti-mala</i> around our necks with his own hands, and said that you should chant and said he will see us next year.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> We did not realize at that moment that how fortunate we were to receive <i>harinama</i> from such an elevated <i>maha-bhagavata</i> though we were so unqualified. We slowly starting realising this two years later when we were in Fiji with Gurudeva. There in one of the morning walks he was asked why he was giving <i>harinama</i> to some Indian families even though they were not practicing any <i>sadhana</i>. Gurudeva replied that these people have no hope in this lifetime to do any <i>sadhana-bhakti</i>. By giving them <i>harinama</i>, he was giving them an opportunity that they will not get in many lifetimes. At that moment I realized that we were in the same category and out of his causeless mercy he gave us <i>harinama</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>Some memories with Gurudeva</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In 2001 Brisbane Sanga organized our first public <i>harikatha</i> for Gurudeva at the Brisbane Hindu temple, Burbank for three days. Before this Gurudeva used to come to stay for one or two days for rest before or after going to Murwillumbah, and there were informal house programs only. When I was driving Gurudeva to temple with Madhava Maharaja and Brajnatha prabhu in the car, I told Gurudeva how I was called for a meeting with the ISKCON president. They had asked me not to host Gurudeva and also threatened me that what will happen to me when Gurudeva leaves because he was of advanced age. They also told me that I will not be allowed to visit ISKCON. When Gurudeva heard this he told me that if you wanted, then no-one can stop you from going to ISKCON as the temple belongs to Srila Prabhupada. Also tell them that ‘When Narayana Maharaja leaves, he will leave behind seven Narayana Maharajas behind.’ I told this incident to Sripad B.V. Bhaktisara Maharaja and he put this up on internet. So true is Gurudeva, we know now that all our Maharajas and even <i>brahmacaris</i> and so many <i>didis</i> trained by Gurudeva are giving such nice <i>harikatha</i>. This is not available in any other Gaudiya matha. We are forever grateful to Sri Gurudeva.</p> <div class="border border-saffron-300 rounded-md rounded-b-none shadow my-8 bg-orange-100 bg-spacer bg-center"> <div class="px-8 py-8 w-full"> <img class="object-contain sm:max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/storage/uploads/WjAa4I96biFAJOrEmSKOF6i39DnVhQwwZ3tpZGSl.jpeg" alt="Srila Gurudeva, Hari Katha" /> </div> <div class="px-8 py-4 text-lg font-bold text-center text-white bg-saffron-300"> Srila Gurudeva, Hari Katha </div></div> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In 2005 we, along with our teenage daughter, Madhuri and son Kapil, went to see Gurudeva to take his blessings in his room at our place. This was a day before he was supposed to leave Brisbane. He blessed Madhuri and Kapil and told us that we should arrange marriage for Madhuri according to our Gujarati system. We should look for a suitable boy within our community and do not be worried whether he is a devotee or not. “My blessings is with her wherever she goes, she will bring all her family to me.” Today Madhuri’s family is very favourable to our <i>sanga</i>, and her husband also took <i>gopala-mantra</i> and <i>harinama</i> from Gurudeva. Her mother-in-law has last year took <i>harinama</i> from Sripad Madhava Maharaja.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In the same year my wife Karuna approached Gurudeva asking him for his blessings and told him that she is not able to remember most of the <i>harikatha</i>. Gurudeva asked her ‘Do you want to become <i>mahisis</i> of Dvaraka?’ She said “No”. Then he asked, ‘Do you want to become Mathura-ramani?’ She said “No”. He asked ‘Then what do you want to be?’ She said that she wants to be a <i>dasi</i> of Radharani.” This is what you have taught us. Then Gurudeva said, “<i>yeh to yada hai</i>”, meaning “See, you remember this.” “<i>yahi to janana hai</i>”. Meaning this is what you need to know.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Our Gurudeva is omniscient, able to see everything which may not be visible. In one of his visits to our home, we were taking Gurudeva to the airport early one morning. Gurudeva would usually come out last after everyone had left the house. Gurudeva, Sripad Madhava Maharaja, Brajanath prabhu and I were just driving out of the garage driveway, when Madhava Maharaja remembered that he had left something in Gurudeva’s room. So we stopped. In another car which was waiting outside with Karuna, Vrinda didi and Pundarik prabhu. Madhava Maharaja called out to Pundarik prabhu to get it. Pundarik prabhu ran in to the house through the garage door. As he ran in he slipped. I saw him falling. Gurudeva was looking down at his <i>mala</i> and Madhava Maharaja and Brajanath prabhu were seating in the rear seat. As I only saw him fall, I said ‘Oh! Oh!’ Madhava Maharaja asked what happened, Gurudeva still looking down replied, Pundarik is doing “ Dandavats”. I did not say anything. After we came back home from airport, I inspected where Pundarik Prabhu had fallen, as there was a dent in the wall. This was done by his legs when he slipped, and to my surprise he fell with his head towards our prayer-room, therefore paying <i>dandavats</i> to our Thakuraji.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Once I was driving Gurudeva from Brisbane airport to Murwillumbah. Gurudeva and his party had arrived early in the morning after a long flight. Madhava Maharaja and Brajanatha prabhu, who were sitting in the back seat, were dozing. It seemed that Gurudeva was also sleeping. I was watching Gurudeva as I was driving. And noticed that at times his fingers were moving in his <i>japa-bag</i>, sometimes at a very fast rate and at times it was not moving at all. Suddenly Gurudeva woke up and asked where is <i>kirtana</i> playing. I told him we were in the car and no one was doing <i>kirtana</i>. Then after 15 or 20 minutes he again said, “See <i>kirtana</i> is going on”. Then I asked him if I should play some <i>kirtana</i> CD in the car. He said 'No, no need.'</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b>In conclusion:</b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Once Sripad Vana Maharaja told me that 'The Gurudeva you know is very different from the Gurudeva that was in Mathura when we were with him. He has become very soft and generous when he started touring overseas.' We are very fortunate that Gurudeva came into our lives even though we are unworthy, he bestowed his mercy on us and our children. We are ever so grateful to all the Vaisnavas who gave us some opportunity to serve Gurudeva.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Haribol</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Yours in service,</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Ram Prakash Das and Karunamayi Dasi <br></p> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/contact" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
