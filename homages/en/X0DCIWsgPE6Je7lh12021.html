offer my dandavat pranamas at the lotus feet of nitya-lila pravista om visnupada astottara-sata Sri Rupanuga Acarya varya Sri Srimad Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Offering <i>puspanjali</i> of words in Srila Gurudeva's lotus feet ... hmm ... It's not so simple. Words are insufficient; vocabulary is too tiny for his glories to fit into! The ocean of legacies he left for us, has a vast expanse, and unfathomable depth. I will try to describe a humble shadow of it's tiny drop, in short. I still remember the first time I read a sample of Srila Gurudeva's kindle edition book on Amazon. (I was, then in no condition to buy a book, first.) It was like a mine full of knowledge. And the first thought to enter my mind was, "Wow. This personality is like a real beacon. He can so easily guide others towards the truth, with his light. Wow! The ones who gets his guidance early on in their life must be so so lucky. I wonder who can fathom the value of knowledge contained in each of his pearls of wisdom. This fountain of spiritual knowledge just flowing freely through his <i>harikatha</i> is something I have never experienced anywhere. And it certainly doesn't belong to this world. Why didn't I find it sooner. Why did I have to wait so long? " <br></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> To properly explain what I meant, Let me start from the beginning.<br></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> As a girl raised in India, everywhere I saw, anytime I saw, there was no shortage of comparisons. I'm sure you must be familiar with at least one of the following, "Rich .. good. Poor .. bad! Fair skin .. good. Dark skin .. bad ! Strong .. good. Weak .. a burden on earth. Men .. Very good. Women .. evil, doorway to hell! " And so on and so forth.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Religion preached to the masses too, was unfortunately no different,"<i>aham brahmasmi</i> ... that is (I am God, but you are not! ) Love is for idiots, mercy is for fools. You know 99.9% of people are too dumb for<i> 'US '.</i> Too dumb to understand all of this even if we preach. So <i>' WE ' </i>don't preach ! With great fortune you have found 'us'. Serve us for years, that is your only destiny. If you serve enough someday forty years from now, we ' might 'tell you the secret to the soul. So right now, don't ask questions. Trust me. Religion is what I tell. My word is the law. You won't understand, just serve me and be grateful for this opportunity."</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Nothing of the above made any sense to me at 8 - 9 years of age. If God actually wanted to play favourites, why did He give all people the same body, same two eyes, two ears, one nose, one heart, similar red-coloured blood? Wouldn't he give extra hearts, extra kidneys to his supposedly favoured people, so that if one organ fails, there would be extra to carry on its function. If women were supposed to follow only, first her father and then her husband, then why did God give them a brain at all? If men were meant to be divided by country, race, money, why does everyone laugh the same, why does everyone cry the same?</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So maybe I don't know the full understanding of <i>dharma</i> (sacred knowledge). Maybe if I knew all of it, it would start making sense) :) Hey, I was 8 years old ! I thought all knowledge was in some 20-page shiny book, with nice coloured pictures. If I could just find it, my problems would be solved!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So I started to really pay attention, if someone could just mention the name of the book or where it was kept. Every six months later, there was a new Figure, a new Baba, or lady, or a new lecturer, who, supposedly, <i>"Knew all of it properly!", </i>was<i> “so much better than the present one." </i>Some were recommended to us by relatives, some by grocery store owners, some by strangers on the bus, some advertised on TV or pamphlets. Every one more capable than, more knowledgeable than, more you know .. in fashion than, who we were listening to right now. We would subscribe to their books, I was too small to read local languages, so I would beg my parents to read it to me. Alas, no one named the ‘Shiny book of all Knowledge!’</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> We had a tiny Bhagavad Gita, only <i>slokas</i> and their alleged explanations (pure quality, 100% <i>advaitavadi</i> , of course! ). By the time I was fourteen, I had read it 3 to 4 times completely, and it felt like one sentence told a completely opposite meaning than the previous one. Nothing made sense as to what is the real path. A collective <i>dharma</i> of all living beings.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I read books and books, heard lectures, watched sermons on TV. Some said ‘follow Durga’, some said ‘don't even think of anything other than Siva’, others said ‘Ganesa was the final authority’, some said ‘Just be a <i>pativrata</i> and worship your husband.’ There were literally, (I am not applying any hyperbole or exaggeration here) hundreds of demigods and goddesses whom I prayed to show me the real path. A path suitable for all. If I'm a helpless <i>jiva</i> desperately searching for knowledge, how can I be <i>Brahma</i> - the all powerful, full of knowledge and happiness?</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> And then things began to turn, we finally happened to hear a person's lecture on TV, who now I know, was preaching something similar to Gaudiya Vaisnava philosophy. (But he preached that all Vaisnava theories Ramanuja, etc. and Sankaracarya theory would lead to the same result.) However finally some sentences from the Bhagavad Gita had started making sense to me. He would quote <i>slokas</i> from the scriptures, with their reference number, some would feel right and I used to quickly write them down in my notebook. He used words like <i>raganuga</i>, <i>sneha</i>, <i>mana</i>, <i>raga</i>. But not anything more.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So now I set out to find the meanings of these words, and <i>slokas</i>. I read Gita, small books from Puranas and also other lecturer's works. Lord Krsna was the root of all demigods and goddesses, so praying to anyone or everyone of those, all lead to the Supreme Lord Himself, ... but who was He ? What were the untold details of His <i>lilas</i>? He interacted with so many devotees in so many of His forms, but certainly there must be some hierarchy. Devi Kunti's and Mother Yasoda's relationship with Krsna, and Sugriva's relationship with Rama and Bali's relationship with Visnu, surely they all couldn't be on the same level, right? Or maybe they were the same, and I'm crazy to imagine a gradation? Some underwent lots of hardships for hundreds of thousands of years, ultimately to ask for some boon, ... usually power or immortality! Did <i>gopis</i> or Sita, Parvati, Laksmana and other devotees too, ask for something in the end? Or was their selfless love at the end reciprocated by merging them with the impersonal Brahman, being separated from the only One whom they chose to love? If not where are they now? Doesn't Lord miss their affection during thousands of years between two <i>avatara</i> cycles. Two successive Krsna <i>avataras</i> must be separated by <i>yugas</i>, during this time does he hunger for Mother Yasoda's handmade butter, yearn for his friend's funny antics? Or that the Lord is impersonal, and unemotional, with a stone like impassive face and the idea of presence of any feelings or yearnings within him, is just my distorted imagination due to being affected by <i>maya</i>?</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Believe me, whoever listened to my doubts thought I was missing a few brain spare parts, ...was 'a few cents short of a quarter, upstairs ' you know.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I continued to hear the above mentioned person's lectures alongside my search for books (there was not much of internet then ). But all these people miraculously managed to give hours of lecture on end, about bhakti for years, without once mentioning or explaining what was <i>vaidhi</i> or <i>raganuga</i>, or what was pure devotion or devotion tainted with karma or knowledge. Looking back now I'm surprised!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I continued my search fruitlessly for the next 12 years. Some claiming they were Siva incarnate, some claiming they were Visnu and Laksmi. Some saying they were combination of Brahma, Visnu and Siva. One woman thought she was Krsna's lover, another thought he was Pandharpura's Krsna incarnate and so and so. I even found picture of someone with hands like blessing pose, photo-shopped such that <i>gopis</i> were offering him <i>arati</i>. It all felt wrong on so many levels. Even though I had no real knowledge or any smidgen of definitive proof of these ideas being absurd, but in my heart on some level I knew it was wrong.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Finally, as answer to my years and years of prayers, I found Srila Gurudeva's book in 2014. It was a free kindle sample of Gopi Gita book on Amazon. By that time, I was too hopeless to find someone who took devotion seriously. I came across it by accident. As I read it. I finished reading it in minutes. It was unbelievable. I read it again and again. I knew I had to buy the book anyhow. (By that time spending almost 40 Rs (approximately half a dollar ) for me was extravagant spending !)</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Somehow the universe allowed me to buy it. I read each page again and again. It is said that in equatorial areas, like Amazon forest, it rains nearly everyday, right? But if you want to know it's real significance, ask the people living in deserts. They will know the significance of each drop. They know how to cherish the cloudy sky, to wait anxiously as the sky rumbles each time announcing the more and more proximity of imminent rain, to anticipate each second, before the first drop touches their hands, the intoxicating heavenly smell of freshly wet earth. Imagine them experiencing rainfall for the first time in their life, after a long search of nearly 18 years.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> That was me reading, no, no, relishing each word, feasting through pages. Imagine a beggar searching the roads for years without once getting a penny and suddenly getting an endless fortune. Yes, yes I was that lucky beggar. At the end of the book were definitions of words I had been questing for years! Wow !! Unbelievable !!!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I was very less fortunate to have to wait so long. Imagine the vast good fortune of some devotees who found Srila Gurudeva's shelter early on in their lives. Vastly blessed are their kids who got Srila Gurudeva as their personal guardian since birth. Their ears were never tainted by <i>advaitavada</i> or other pseudo-religions. They all are the real recipients of Gaurasundara's mercy. I bow down to them all. I believe there must be some accounting mistake (or spelling or identity mistake ) in heaven, because of which a fallen person like me was allowed to get Srila Gurudeva's lotus feet shelter along with these exalted souls.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It is extremely difficult to find someone in this Kali-yuga, who could understand the words of Srila Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His associates. How difficult then must it be to find someone who can explain it to others, who are supremely less intelligent than him? Our Srila Gurudeva is the pinnacle of embodiment of both, ‘<i>svajatiya-snigdha-asaya</i>’ and one who generously showers his mercy on fallen souls.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> For other so-called gurus, <i>sisyas</i> are their personal property and their words are not to be doubted. Asking even a simple doubt or interrupting them is equivalent to challenging their authority.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> But with Srila Gurudeva, it is exactly opposite. He proceeds slowly to explain, allowing all to ask doubts, slowly going deeper into any topic, being endlessly patient even if someone interrupts. He never reveals his true stature, always diligently playing the role of a <i>madhyama</i> or <i>uttama-adhikari</i>. Who amongst us can know really how much <i>uttama</i> or <i>uttama uttama-uttama-mahabhagvata</i> he really is? Let alone for me - the one who has no <i>adhikara</i> whatsoever, let alone <i>kanistha</i> or anything ... - the talk of really guessing what exalted <i>adhikara</i> of true devotees is ridiculously absurd!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It is said the best things in the world are free. So Srila Gurudeva's books, lectures, his audio or video <i>harikatha</i> are too. This is his unconditional mercy on people like me. For years I have downloaded and read and heard his lectures for free! It is a real non-repayable loan on us by Srila Gurudeva and his numerous devotees who took time transcribing the lectures, gathering and sorting all the recordings.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Some years ago I lost something very precious - my reason to live. It seemed like a cruel and unusual punishment for life to make me continue living, when it took away the very basis of my existence. Each day I tried to come up with a reason to live. There was none. Each minute of each day I spent trying to come up with an answer to this question to myself, "Why are you still alive, when there is no reason for you to live?" One day I answered to myself - " I lived today to read two of Srila Gurudeva's lectures, and I will live till tomorrow to read two more of his nectarean lectures." His lectures were the ones who held my hand and guided me through the darkest years of my life. How does anyone ever repay such a debt? I owe him my life.”<br><br>The glories of Srila Gurudeva are so many, I would advise all to hear about them from true devotees. I'm but a normal person, I tried to glorify him as much as my tiny intelligence could grasp. I beg forgiveness at all yours' and Srila Gurudeva's lotus feet for trying to write about his transcendental glories and qualities with my filthy material mind.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Hoping for Srila Gurudeva's and your eternal, causeless mercy.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ????</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> An insignificant, yet eternally grateful beggar,</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Pallavi K.</p> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/contact" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
