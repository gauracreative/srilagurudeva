He had also been engaged for several years in organizing the renovation of many holy places in Vṛndāvana, such as Bhāṇḍīravaṭa in Bhāṇḍīravana, Kadamba-kyārī near Nandagrāma, Brahma-kuṇḍa and Surabhi-kuṇḍa in Govardhana, and Kāliya-ghāṭa in Vṛndāvana. His work in this regard is recognized by the public, the government and the press. For this and his other spiritual achievements, he was awarded the title <b><i>Yuga-Ācārya</i></b> by the heads of the various villages throughout Vraja-maṇḍala</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I am presenting a few important teachings of Śrīla Gurudeva so that a wretched person like me does not forget his mission.<b></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>Importance of listening <i>hari-kathā</i> attentively</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva always told us to listen to the hari-kathā very attentively. He spoke as follows:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> If you read something, you should get absorbed in it, having the attitude that “I am serving this <i>grantha</i> (sacred text) and am taking all these instructions in my heart.” We should not read superficially, hearing with one ear and letting it go out from the other.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> There is a very beautiful story which illustrates this point. In India there was once a king named Vikramāditya. He had so many “jewels”—his counselors—nine court jewels. All nine were highly learned, but among them Kālidāsa was supremely intelligent. One day a person looking like a madman came, holding a skull in his hand. He was quite naked and very dirty. He came in the council of Vikramāditya and put that skull on the desk, saying, “I have heard there are many intelligent jewels in your court, your council. Let them come here and test whether the person whose skull this is was intelligent or a fool and rascal.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Eight jewels were there, very learned persons, and the whole council was full, but none of them were able to reply. Only the skull was there, nothing else, so how could they test it? Then that madman began to laugh and said, “You are all bogus, foolish persons with no sense. I had heard this, and now I have found out that it is true. So I am going.” And he took the skull, preparing to leave. In the meantime, Kalidāsa came. The King requested the madman, “Oh, wait a little. Another one of my counselors is coming, and he will answer your question”. That person put the skull on the desk again, and Kālidāsa came. Again this same question was asked to Kālidāsa, who then took a long coconut stick made of very fine, long strands used for sweeping and went to the skull. He put the stick in one ear and it came out the other side, through the other ear. Then he said, “Your question is answered. Do you understand ?” “Oh, you should clarify more,” the King said. “I do not understand.” Kālidāsa explained, “If anything comes in one ear and goes out the other, that person is surely foolish. And if something goes in one ear and does not come out the other, but instead goes into the heart, then he is surely a very intelligent person. Thus, from his skull we can understand that this dead person was very foolish.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So, if we hear so many things but do not take them into the heart, if we do not cultivate all these teachings, then we are like a foolish person and cannot develop our <i>kṛṣṇa-prema</i>. You have come from many distant, far-away places. So don’t merely take these teachings in one ear and let them go out the other, but keep them in your heart and follow them.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Not one of us has come for any worldly gain. We have come here only to see how we can develop our <i>kṛṣṇa-bhakti</i>. Generally we are <i>kaniṣṭha-adhikārīs</i>. It may be rare that some of us are <i>madhyama-adhikārī</i>, but not <i>uttama-adhikārī</i> in any case. As <i>kaniṣṭhas</i> and <i>madhyamas</i>, we should try to develop by hearing the instructions of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, as explained by Śrīla Svāmījī. When I say “Svāmījī” or “Bhaktivedānta Svāmījī Mahārāja,” you should understand that I am speaking of my <i>śikṣā-guru,</i> Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Svāmī Mahārāja, your Prabhupāda.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>We are mono-theists</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva always emphasized the fact that the members of Gauḍīya Maṭha are mono-theists. We have only one object of worship i.e. Lord Kṛṣṇa. He explained this as follows:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Kalki, and Vāmana are not separate gods. Kṛṣṇa is the only God. He is manifesting Himself sometimes as Rāma, sometimes as Himself, Kṛṣṇa, and sometimes as others. There are not many different supreme Gods. The one supreme God is Kṛṣṇa.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Who is Śaṅkara? Who is Hanumān, Durgā, and Kali? Muslims or Westerners sometimes say, "You Hindus are worshipers of so many gods and goddesses." But we can never ever worship others as God. The only God is Kṛṣṇa.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>Śrīla Gurudeva's great respect for Lord Śiva</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva used to observe an Ekādaśī-like fast on the day of Mahā-śiva-rātrī. He told that this fast (<i>vrata</i>) is mentioned in <i>Hari-bhakti-vilāsa</i>. He explains that Lord Śiva is our spiritual master who teaches <i>bhakti</i> by his personal example.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śaṅkara must be followed as <i>guru</i>, Pārvatī, as <i>guru</i>, and Hanumān as <i>guru</i>. In the service of Rāma, only one very small monkey came flying in the air from India, he entered Laṅkā, and in a moment he destroyed and burnt the whole city. How? Śaṅkara had become Hanumān. There are so many examples in <i>śāstra</i> (scriptures) which explain how Śaṅkara is the subordinate servant of Kṛṣṇa. Bhasmāsura wanted to burn Śaṅkara. He had a boon from him, but Kṛṣṇa came and saved him Otherwise, Śaṅkara was in great danger.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Lord Śiva is very dear to Kṛṣṇa and, by his mercy, many were able to enter the <i>rāsa</i> dance. He even received the form of a <i>gopī</i>. Because Śiva is so dear to Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī liked to live near him at Kāmyavana, Mānasī Gaṅgā, and other places.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Some people say that devotees of Kṛṣṇa should not take <i>darśana</i> of Śiva. However, as followers of Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, we take his <i>darśana</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><i><u>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</u></i></b><b><u> is the best evidence </u></b><b></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b> </b>Śrīla Gurudeva who the person Bhāgavata and <i>jīvanta-mṛdaṅga</i>. He had the greatest regard for the book Bhāgavata also. He says:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Who is <i>dīkṣā-guru</i>? Who is <i>śikṣā-guru</i>? The same qualifications will be there in both. For example, <i>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</i> is the best evidence, more so than the <i>Vedas</i>, more than the <i>Upaniṣads</i>, more than <i>Mahābhārata</i>, <i>Hari-vaṁśa</i>, the other <i>Purāṇas</i>, or any other <i>grantha</i>, scripture. It is <i>amala-pramāṇa</i>, spotless evidence. Tulasī-dāsa has translated many of the verses of <i>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</i> in his Hindi <i>Rāma-carita-manasā</i>. In writing his Rāmāyaṇa, Vālmīki also took all <i>siddhānta</i> from <i>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</i>. All bona fide gurus are in the same line. They are not against one another.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>The biography of Śrīla Parama-gurudeva</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva wrote the biography of his spiritual master – “Ācārya Keśarī Śrī Śrīmad Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī – His Life and Teachings” This book is unique and very significant. It presents for Western readers the life and teachings of a recent ācārya in a Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava (rather than a Western) environment. Here we directly see the activities and interactions of deeply realized <i>Vaiṣṇava</i> within an authentic Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava culture. We are also privileged to witness the guru-disciple relationship in a line of empowered ācāryas, and to see a variety of expressions of <i>guru-niṣṭhā</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In this biography, Śrīla Gurudeva has presented an overview of essential Gauḍīya <i>siddhānta</i>. He has shown practically how an <i>ācārya</i> preaches and teaches, from the ‘jungle-cutting’ challenges to māyāvāda and the threats of <i>apasampradāyas</i> and <i>apasiddhānta</i>, to the <i>prayojana</i> of Vraja <i>bhakti</i>. This present volume therefore has a very important role in the protection of our <i>sampradāya</i>, both in dispelling illusion and in establishing the real goal.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>What was the need for Śrīla Gurudeva to preach in the west</u></b><b></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b> </b>Śrīla Gurudeva clarifies in the following words the need for a <i>mahā-bhāgavata </i>like him to travel and preach.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāja gave every-thing in his books, yet he knew that a child (new devotee) of one year, two years, or even five years could not comprehend all his teachings. A father and mother save money for their child, keeping it in a locked box. When the child is mature, he will be qualified to properly utilize the treasures inside. Before maturity, however, the child would waste that treasure. Similarly, Śrīla Svāmī Mahārāja kept all his treasures in his books. If you want to open them, you must know that the key is in the hands of the <i>bhakta-bhāgavata.</i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> There are two <i>bhāgavatas</i>: the <i>grantha-bhāgavata</i> (Vedic scriptures) and the <i>bhakta-bhāgavata</i> (pure devotee). The <i>bhakta-bhāgavata</i> is superior in the sense that the key to the treasury of the Vedic scriptures is with that bona fide self-realized devotee who has <i>prema</i>, pure love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He can open the lock.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Within all of his books Śrīla Svāmī Mahārāja has preserved the treasure left by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. In his purports we see all the teachings of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. In The Nectar of Instruction, for example, he gives the process by which we can follow Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and thus enter Vṛndāvana, the abode of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Some persons say, “We are not qualified, and we will never be qualified to hear about Goloka.” I think this is not correct, because Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāja has written about it all in his books. When we become mature and qualified, we will be able to actually taste that nectar.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>Śrīla Gurudeva's followed in the footsteps of Śrīla Svāmī Mahārāja</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Following Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Svāmī Mahārāja's example, Śrīla Gurudeva sacrificed his life for preaching <i>kṛṣṇa-bhakti </i>all over the world. He traveled around world many times on his global preaching tours. He expresses his praise for Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Svāmī Mahārāja in the following words:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Svāmī Mahārāja showed the world, by his example, that even a street beggar who has strong faith in the value of serving his spiritual master, Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, can go anywhere – Śrī Kṛṣṇa will make all arrangements for him. The pure devotee can jump in fire, and he can jump over the Alps, the Himalayas and the ocean. He can go anywhere, for Kṛṣṇa will help him.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Although penniless, Śrīla Svāmī Mahārāja jumped over the ocean. Somehow he traveled by ship, and simply chanted the holy names. As he chanted, he never took note of whether or not anyone was watching him.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> He used to say that if a blind person and a lame person travel together, they can go anywhere they like. He explained that the blind person will take the lame person on his shoulders. The blind person will walk and the lame person will direct. The lame person has eyes, and he will say, “You should go this way and that way.” The Western world is blind and India is lame. India has no source of wealth to preach this mission throughout the world; it has eyes but no legs. America and all other Western countries are very wealthy, but they have no eyes. If both combine and cooperate, we can preach this mission to the entire world.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Svāmī Mahārāja preached throughout the world, and in a few years he accomplished a miracle that has not been seen anywhere else. He was a ‘long arm’ of Śrīla Prabhupāda Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura and Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. In other words, they reached out to the entire world through him, and they predicted his coming. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has written, “I think that within a very few years, thousands of Western devotees, wearing <i>śikhās</i> and <i>tulasī-mālās</i> and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, will join Indian devotees. They will all chant and dance together.” Now we see this everywhere.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Svāmī Mahārāja used to say, “Bombay is my office, Māyāpura is my place of <i>sādhana-bhajana</i> (spiritual practice) and my home is Vṛndāvana.” That is why he came to Vṛndāvana in his final days. He took <i>samādhi</i> there in his home, Vṛndāvana.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa is not <i>māyāvādī</i> (impersonalist or monist)</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva removed the doubts of many by explaining that Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa is a pure devotee of Lord Rāma and his narration of Śrī Rāma's pastimes, namely, <i>Śrī Rāma-carita-manasā </i>propounds correct <i>siddhānta</i> (spiritual conclusions) and has no defect whatsoever. He wrote in one of his letters:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Tulasī dāsajī was a Vaiṣṇava belonging to the <i>Rāmānanda Sampradāya</i>, a branch of the <i>Śrī Sampradāya</i>. All the four <i>Vaiṣṇava Sampradāyas</i> are worthy of our respect. His name, Tulasī dāsa, is a Vaiṣṇava name and he wore the vertical (<i>urddhva-puṇḍra</i>) Vaiṣṇava tilaka. He also wore <i>tulasī-mālā</i> around his neck and was initiated into the <i>śrī-rāma-mantra</i>, which is a <i>mantra</i> for obtaining perfection. His <i>guru</i> was <i>siddha</i> Narahari (Nṛsiṁha-deva) dāsa. His worshipful Deities were Śrī Sītā-Rāmacandra, who are incarnations of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. In his numerous books he often glorified Vrajendranandana Kṛṣṇa. He explained the prominent glories of <i>śrī-nāma</i>, especially for the age of Kali. He translated the Sanskrit ślokas of the <i>Vedas, Upaniṣads, Purāṇas, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, </i>and especially<i> the Rāmāyaṇa,</i> into Hindi poetical verse. He has written on the importance of <i>śaraṇāgati</i>, and he accepted <i>bhagavad-prema</i> as the highest goal and object for the <i>jīvas</i>. He accepted the nine forms of <i>bhakti</i> described in the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>. He accepted the <i>jīvas</i> to be the separated parts-and-parcels of the Lord, as has been explained in the <i>Gītā</i> and <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>. He also accepted the doctrine of <i>acintya bheda-abheda</i> or, in other words, the simultaneous oneness and difference which exists between the omnipotent Lord and His potency (<i>śakti-śaktimān</i>). He completely disregarded <i>sāyujya-mukti</i> and the other forms of liberation. Throughout his writings he refuted the theory of <i>māyāvāda</i>. Therefore, he has not expressed <i>māyāvāda</i> conclusions in any of his writings.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> It is incorrect to think that Śrīmān Madhvācārya has accepted only the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa as authoritative. In his commentary on a statement from the <i>Skanda Purāṇa</i> he has written as follows (quoted in <i>Gauḍīya Kaṇṭha-hāra</i>):<i></i></p> <div class="my-8 text-saffron-300"> <div class="text-xl font-semibold text-center"> ṛg-yajuḥ-sāmātharvāś ca<br />bhārataṁ pañcarātrakam<br />mūla-rāmāyaṇaṁ caiva<br />śāstram ity abhidhīyate<br /><br />yac cānukūlam etasya<br />tac ca śāstraṁ prakīrtitam<br />ato'nya grantha vistaro<br />naiva śāstraṁ kuvatma tat </div> <div class="text-base italic mt-3 text-center ml-36"> &ndash;Śrī Madhvācārya </div> </div> <p class="ce-paragraph"> “The four <i>Vedas</i> – <i>Ṛg, Yajur, Sāma </i>and<i> Atharva</i> – the <i>Mahābhārata</i>, the original <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>, and the Pañcarātra are all authoritative and bona fide scriptures. Any scriptures which follow in support of them are all accepted as authoritative. All other scriptures apart from these are not accepted as authoritative.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>Do not name your disciple or son as Ekalavya</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva tells us not be like Ekalavya and not to name one's disciple as Ekalavya. He elaborates the reason for this:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> You may have heard the names of Droṇācārya and Ekalavya. They were both present in this world 5000 years ago, at the time of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes here. Ekalavya went to Droṇācārya and told him, “I accept you as my guru.” Droṇācārya replied, “I knew you would be coming to me even before you came. I know your heart and pulse; you are very much against pure <i>bhaktas</i> and therefore I will not teach you archery.” Ekalavya then said, “I have accepted you as my guru, so I must learn something about archery from you.” Droṇācārya again refused and said, “I cannot give lessons to you. If you learn archery, you will become a burden to the entire world.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Still determined, Ekalavya went to the forest and made a clay statue of Droṇācārya. He offered <i>praṇāma</i> to that statue and, repeatedly taking the footdust of that statue, he began to practice archery with great faith. Practicing archery while regularly performing <i>arcanā</i> and offering flowers to Droṇācārya, Ekalavya became a master. Then, one day, Droṇācārya went to the forest and saw Ekalavya, and he became astonished to see how he had learned such a high class of archery. When Ekalavya saw Droṇācārya, he fell at his lotus feet and told him, “What I have learned, I have learned from you.” Droṇācārya then told Ekalavya, “If you have really learned archery from me, then I want some <i>guru-dakṣiṇā</i>.” Ekalavya said, “Whatever you wish, I am prepared to give. I am also prepared to give my life if you want that.” Droṇācārya replied, “I want your right-hand thumb.” You would not be able to do this if you were asked to do so by your <i>gurudeva</i>, but Ekalavya did it immediately.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Ekalavya was still able to shoot with his remaining four fingers, but what was the result? During the <i>Mahābhārata</i> battle he wanted to fight with Kṛṣṇa and kill Him; therefore, Kṛṣṇa took His Sudarśana <i>cakra</i> and very easily cut off his head.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In this connection, the <i>śraddhā</i>, faith, of Ekalavya is compared to a clay pot. If one places a clay pot in fire, it will crack. The <i>śraddhā</i> of Ekalavya was like that clay. He was selfish and wanted to ruin the devotees, and because of this ulterior motive his <i>śraddhā</i> in making and worshiping a statue of Droṇācārya was really not <i>śraddhā</i> at all. Our <i>śraddhā</i> should not be like that of Ekalavya; it should be like that of Arjuna. We should always be careful not to have the misconception that he was a good disciple.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>We should be <i>udāra</i> (magnanimous) and not <i>kṛpaṇa</i> (miser)</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva explained the definition <i>kṛpaṇa</i> (miser) to us as follows:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>Kṛpaṇāḥ</i> refers to those who are unable to understand the meaning of <i>niṣkāma-karma-yoga</i>. Such people are attached to the fruits of their activities, and consequently, they are sometimes happy and sometimes distressed. This topic has been explained at length in <i>Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Once, there was a great assembly of realized sages, <i>maharṣis</i> and <i>brahmarṣis</i> in the royal court of Janaka Mahārāja. Janaka Mahārāja, assisted by his royal servants, brought hundreds of milk-giving cows along with their beautiful calves to that assembly. The horns of the cows were encased in gold and their hooves in silver. Beautiful cloth decorated with golden ornaments graced their backs. Folding his hands, Janaka Mahārāja addressed the sages with great humility. “Whoever among you is <i>brahma-vettā</i> (a knower of <i>brahma</i>), I beg you to come and accept these cows.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> All assembled there began to whisper amongst themselves. No one dared come forward to establish himself as <i>brahma-vettā</i> and take the cows. Again, Janaka Mahārāja looked towards them, with all seriousness. This time the<i> maharṣi</i> Yājñavalkya got up and told his students, “O <i>brahmacārīs</i>, take these cows to my <i>āśrama</i>.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Hearing this, the other <i>maharṣis</i> objected, saying, “Are you <i>brahma-vettā</i>?”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Maharṣi Yājñavalkya said, “I offer my obeisances at the feet of those who are <i>brahma-vettā</i>. If you want to examine me or ask any question, please do so.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The various sages asked different questions and Yājñavalkya Maharṣi gave them befitting answers. At last, the greatly learned Gārgī humbly inquired, “Who is a <i>kṛpaṇa</i> and who is a <i>brāhmaṇa</i>?”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Yājñavalkya Maharṣi’s response to this was: <i>yo vā etad akṣaraṁ gārgy aviditvāsmāl lokāt praiti sa kṛpaṇaḥ</i> (<i>Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad</i> 3.8.10). “O Gārgī, that person is a <i>kṛpaṇa</i> (miser) who leaves this world without knowing Śrī Bhagavān, who is Acyuta, the Infallible Absolute Reality.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> (6.9.49) it is said: <i>na veda kṛpaṇaḥ śreya / ātmano guṇa-vastu-dṛk</i>. “<i>Kṛpaṇas</i> are those who consider that the ultimate reality consists only of sense objects produced from the material modes.” Furthermore, it is stated in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> (11.19.44): <i>kṛpaṇo yo ’jitendriyaḥ.</i> “A <i>kṛpaṇa</i> is a person who has no control over his senses.”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><i><u>Five thunder-bolts to pulverize five mountainous misconceptions</u></i></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva wrote and distributed near Rādhā-kuṇḍa the “Five Essays (<i>Prabandha-pañcakam</i>)” free of charge especially to the followers of Rādhā-kuṇḍa <i>bābājīs</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> He defeated the following erroneous arguments:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> (1) Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī and Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī are one and the same personality.<i></i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> (2) <i>Tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa</i> and saffron clothes are not bona fide.<i></i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> (3) <i>Gauḍīya Sampradāya </i>is not under the <i>anugatya</i> (guidance) of Śrī Madhvācārya and Mahāprabhu started his own new <i>sampradāya</i>.<i></i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> (4) <i>Guru-paramparā</i> of Śrīla Bhakti-siddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura Prabhupāda is not bona fide.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> (5) Only a <i>sādhaka</i> who has conquered the six urges (<i>kāma</i>, <i></i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>krodha</i>, etc.), who is free from all <i>anarthas</i> and fully purified from the heart disease of lust, is eligible to hear the topics of Śrī Veṇu-gīta, Śrī <i>Rāsa Pañcādhyāya</i>, <i>Yugala-gīta</i>, <i>Bhramara-gīta</i> and so on, as described in the Tenth Canto of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>.<i></i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Nowadays, people are concocting newer and newer doubts about <i>Śrī guru-paramparā</i> in the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Sampradāya. Some people believe that Śrī Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa was initiated in the Madhva Sampradāya and that he was not actually a Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava. They assert that, although he had the association of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, the influence of the Madhva Sampradāya was so strong that in his own writings he stubbornly included Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Sampradāya as part of the Madhva Sampradāya. They claim that there is no reasonable justification for this, and that Śrī Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa can therefore not be accepted as an <i>ācārya</i> of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Sampradāya. Another group of ignorant people say that Jagadguru Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupādajī created a completely new concept which he called the <i>bhāgavata-paramparā</i>. According to them, he has explained in this supposedly new doctrine of <i>bhāgavata-paramparā</i> that Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura is a disciple of Vaiṣṇava Sārvabhauma Śrīla Jagannātha dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja, and that Śrī Gaura Kiśora Dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja is a disciple of Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. Some <i>sahajiyā</i> Vaiṣṇavas also present the doubt that Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī’s <i>guru-paramparā</i> cannot be considered bona fide because he accepted the renounced order (<i>sannyāsa</i>) from himself. <i>Paramārādhya</i> Śrīla Gurudeva has shattered all these accusations with powerful logic and solid scriptural evidence.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In the present time some perversions have come in the system of <i>sannyāsa</i>. What are they?</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> (1) Some householder <i>Vaiṣṇavas</i> become <i>bābājīs</i>, having shaven their heads and put on a <i>kaupīna</i>. What can be more injurious than this? Their action is opposed to śāstra and to the interests of society. If they are actually detached from material life then they may accept <i>bheka</i> in genuine renunciation. Otherwise they will disgrace <i>vaiṣṇava-dharma</i> and in the next life they will also have to taste the fruit of doing so.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> (2) There is a terrible and disastrous custom among <i>bābājīs</i> of keeping maidservants in their <i>āśramas</i>. In some <i>āśramas</i> a <i>bābājī</i> may even keep his own wife from his previous <i>āśrama</i> in the form of a maidservant. These people associate with women on the pretext of service to God and service to <i>sādhus</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> (3) <i>Bābājīs</i> who are actually renounced completely reject the greed for women, wealth, eatables and so on. Nowadays, common people are losing faith in <i>Vaiṣṇavism</i>, because they see that these defects are spreading among supposedly renounced people. The essence of the matter is that those who accept the symbols of renunciation without having developed the genuine detachment which arises from <i>rati</i> (love of Bhagavān) are a disturbance in society and a disgrace to <i>vaiṣṇava-dharma.</i> Their own downfall and the defamation of <i>vaiṣṇava-dharma</i> are both guaranteed when they accept <i>bheka</i> before they are qualified to do so.” <i></i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> After Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura and Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, a dark age began in Śrīman Mahāprabhu’s Gauḍīya Sampradāya, during which the current of <i>śrī rūpānugā-bhakti</i> became somewhat impaired. Various kinds of speculative malpractices and opinions opposed to <i>śuddha-bhakti</i> became mixed in with the true conception. At that time the situation was so dire that the educated and cultured section of society began to hate even the name of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism, having witnessed the misbehavior of its followers. In this way the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Sampradāya became distanced from the intelligentsia and respected society. At that time the Seventh Gosvāmī Saccidānanda Bhakti-vinoda Ṭhākura and Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī appeared. These two personalities brought about a revolutionary transformation in the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Sampradāya and restored its lost dignity. To these two <i>mahā-puruṣas</i> and their followers goes the entire credit for whatever diffusion of Śrīman Mahāprabhu’s <i>nāma-saṅkīrtana</i> and <i>śuddha-bhakti</i> has taken place among the learned and respectable sector of society, not only in India but also throughout the world. They have established the Gauḍīya Maṭḥa preaching centers of <i>śuddha-bhakti</i> everywhere; they have published the literatures of <i>śuddha-bhakti </i>along with magazines and journals in all of the major languages of the world; and thus in a very short time they have revolutionized the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava society. After the disappearance of <i>Jagadguru</i> Śrīla Prabhupāda these improper practices began to appear openly in all the prominent places of <i>Śrī Vraja-maṇḍala, Gauḍa-maṇḍala and Kṣetra-maṇḍala.</i> These groups of <i>bābājīs</i> began to make allegations against Śrīla Prabhupāda and the <i>śuddha-vaiṣṅavas</i> under his shelter. They said that <i>Vaiṣṇavas</i> of the Gauḍīya Maṭha are simple <i>jnānīs</i> who are ignorant of rasa-tattva, and that their acceptance of reddish cloth and <i>sannyāsa</i> is not properly established procedure. Paramārādhyatama Śrīla Gurudeva has refuted these accusations with scriptural evidence and powerful arguments and has preached <i>śuddha-bhakti</i> everywhere.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><i><u>Siddha-praṇālī</u></i></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva warned us that s<i>iddha-praṇālī</i> is very much misused nowadays in certain places in Vraja-maṇḍala, Gauḍa-maṇḍala and Kṣetra-maṇḍala. Some people are abused and even driven from their homes when their wives pass away. Although they are bereft of <i>tattva-jñāna</i> and unaware of <i>vaidhī-bhakti-sādhana</i>, they have their heads shaved in the middle of the night, put on kaupīna and quickly take <i>siddha-praṇālī</i>. These days <i>siddha-praṇālī</i> can be obtained very easily by giving half a rupee. Just before giving mantra a financial contract takes place. These people think, “There can be no auspiciousness for <i>sādhakas</i> until they acquire <i>siddha-praṇālī.</i> There is no necessity for <i>vaidhī-bhakti sādhana, tattva-jñāna </i>or<i> anartha-nivṛtti.</i> The <i>rāgānugā-bhakta</i> should obtain <i>siddha-praṇālī</i> before he goes through <i>anartha-nivṛtti.</i> In that way he can avoid getting caught in the inconvenience of <i>vaidhī-bhakti</i>.” These people’s conception is exactly like thinking that a fruit will grow from a leaf before the appearance of a flower.<i></i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>Śrīla Gurudeva one-pointed dedication to Śrī Rādhā</u></b><b></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b> </b> Śrīla Gurudeva eloquence knew no bounds while glorifying Śrī Rādhā. In one of his harikatha lectures, he explained:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī has heard about Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa from Śrīla Svarūpa Dāmodara, Śrīla Rāya Rāmānanda, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, and especially from Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, and thus he is giving this tattva. Śrīmatī Rādhikā is Govinda-nandinī, and there is nothing higher than this.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī has revealed some of the names of Rādhikā in his <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta Ādi-līlā</i> chapter four. One of Her names is Govinda-nandinī. Govinda is the controller of everything. He is the extreme limit of the conception of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa. He has unlimited opulence and sweetness. Who can give happiness to Him? Only one can do so - Kṛṣṇa Himself in the form of Śrīmatī Rādhikā.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> She is also <i>Govinda-mohinī</i>. Kṛṣṇa attracts all living entities, including animals, trees, and creepers. He especially attracts all of the Vraja <i>gopīs</i>, but Rādhikā can attract Him. Kṛṣṇa bewilders everyone in this world by His <i>māyā-śakti</i>, and in the spiritual world He bewilders all by His beautiful form, qualities, and pastimes. He can bewilder everyone, yet Rādhikā can bewilder Him.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Rādhikā is <i>Govinda-sarvasva</i>. She is everything to Kṛṣṇa. She is the all in all of Kṛṣṇa; for Him, nothing remains outside Her.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrī Rādhā is <i>Sarva-kāntā-siromoṇi</i>, the crown jewel of all Kṛṣṇa's beloveds. All the <i>gopīs</i> were searching for Kṛṣṇa after His disappearance from the rasa dance. When Her own <i>svapakṣā-gopīs</i> (the gopīs in Her personal group) saw Her footprints along with Kṛṣṇa's, they became very happy, knowing them to be Hers. However, when the other groups of <i>gopīs</i> saw those footprints, not knowing to whom they belonged, they could only understand that this particular <i>gopī</i> had served Kṛṣṇa more than any other, and therefore He had left the <i>rāsa</i> dance with Her alone.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>All the <i>gopīs</i> are expansions of Śrī Rādhā</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva elucidated that Śrī Rādhā Herself has become Candrāvalī and all the other <i>gopīs</i>. There is no other beloved of Kṛṣṇa–only Śrīmatī Rādhikā. Śrīmatī Rādhikā Herself has become all the Lakṣmīs, and all the queens of Dvārakā. If one thinks deeply about this, he will understand Her greatness. Sītā-devī and all the Lakṣmīs are manifestations of Rādhā, and she assumes these forms to fulfill Kṛṣṇa's desires.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>Rādhikā is worshipable by everyone</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva expounded that Sri Radha is <i>Kṛṣṇa-mayī</i>; She sees Kṛṣṇa everywhere–inside and outside of Herself. Wherever Her mind or senses go, it is only to, for, and about Kṛṣṇa. When She sees a <i>tamāla</i> tree She thinks, "Oh, there is Kṛṣṇa." Her name is Rādhikā because She fulfills all the desires of Kṛṣṇa and because He Himself worships Her. An example of His worshiping Her is when He took Her to a solitary place after leaving the <i>rāsa</i> dance, at which time even the <i>vipakṣā-gopīs</i> (cowherd damsels that belong to the rival party) also confirm this. Rādhikā is <i>Para-devatā</i>, just as Kṛṣṇa is: She is the most worshipable of all. Moreover, She is worshiped by Kṛṣṇa Himself. Is she not therefore worshipable by everyone?</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>Rādhikā is Kṛṣṇa's <i>prema-guru</i> (teacher of love and dance)</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva narrated that once Rādhikā asked Vṛndā-devī, "Where are you coming from?" Vṛndā-devī replied, "I'm coming from Rādhā-kuṇḍa, and I saw Kṛṣṇa there." Rādhārāṇī asked, "What was He doing?" Vṛndā-devī replied that He was dancing. Rādhā then asked, "Oh, who was His dancing teacher?" Vṛndā-devī told Her, "Your reflection, Rādhikā, which He sees in every tree."</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Whatever <i>prema</i> exists in this world comes from Rādhikā. She is the mother of everyone because she nourishes everyone by giving them prema. Kṛṣṇa is the principle Deity of all <i>jīvas</i>, and Rādhikā is also.

As many beloveds as there are, She is their controlling deity. She is Kānti, which means that during <i>rāsa-līlā</i>, only She could fulfill the desires of Kṛṣṇa. There were hundreds and millions of <i>gopīs</i> dancing, but when Rādhikā left, the <i>rāsa</i> dance stopped. Kṛṣṇa appears as Mahāprabhu in order to taste all of Rādhikā's loving moods, because He cannot do so in Vraja-līlā.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>Three Features of Śrīmatī Rādhikā</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva disclosed.…. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī writes in Lalita-Mādhava that when Kṛṣṇa went to Mathurā and Dvārakā, Śrīmatī Rādhikā was in such a deep state of separation that She went to Khelana-vana, where She entered the waters of Yamunā and drowned. Then, through the rays of the sun, She went to the Sun-planet. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī is silent about what transpired between that time and Her arrival as Satyabhāmā in Nava-Vṛndāvana, Dvārakā, but he explains that once there, She met Rukmiṇī.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Rukmiṇī thought, “Oh, this girl is exquisitely beautiful! If Kṛṣṇa sees Her, He will be attracted to Her and will no longer love me as He does now.” She tried to keep the new girl from the sun planet hidden from Kṛṣṇa, hoping to prevent Him from seeing Her. Nevertheless, Kṛṣṇa eventually saw Her and fell in love with Her at once. Because Rukmiṇī continued her attempt to stop Kṛṣṇa and Satyabhāmā (Rādhikā) from meeting, Satyabhāmā felt such painful separation from Kṛṣṇa that She went to the Kāliya Lake in Nava-Vṛndāvana with the aim of being bitten by the poisonous serpents there. She jumped into the lake and, unknown to Her, Kṛṣṇa saw Her and jumped in after Her. When He caught hold of Her from be-hind, Satyabhāmā thought with relief, “Oh, here are two black snakes, full of poison, and they are about to bite Me.” She could not imagine that Kṛṣṇa Himself was holding Her until He turned Her around to face Him. Upon seeing Him, She came to her external senses and fell on His chest. Rukmiṇī saw this and thought, “I tried hard to keep them apart, but I was not successful. Now they should be married.” Kṛṣṇa then proposed to Satyabhāmā and married Her.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Who is the teenage girl who traveled by the rays of the sun to Nava-Vṛndāvana in Dvārakā? And who went to Kurukṣetra to meet with Kṛṣṇa there? This is a significant point. The explanation is that there are three features of Śrīmatī Rādhikā. One of them, Her complete feature, is the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja and Kīrtidā-devī. Just as Śrī Nanda-nandana, the son of Nanda Mahārāja, is the cause or origin of all His expansions, so Śrīmatī Rādhikā, the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja and Kīrtidā-devī, is the origin of all Her female expansions. Neither Vṛṣabhānu-nandinī nor Kṛṣṇa ever leaves Vṛndāvana. She may think that He has gone somewhere else for a short time and feel separation from Him then, but She never thinks that He has permanently gone anywhere else.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> There are different types of separation (<i>pravāsa</i>) that occur before the four main types of meeting: <i>saṅkṣipta, saṅkīrṇa, sampanna, </i>and<i> samṛddhimān.</i> There is a small separation in the daytime when Kṛṣṇa goes out to herd the cows. Sometimes <i>māna</i>, the sulky mood of transcendental loving jealous anger, comes between Rādhikā and Kṛṣṇa like a wall. This is also a kind of separation, because They cannot talk or interact, even though They are together. <i>Sudūra-pravāsa</i> takes place when They are separated for many years, as when Śrī Kṛṣṇa leaves Vṛndāvana for Mathurā and Dvārakā. When They meet after such a lengthy separation, They feel supremely blissful.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In Vṛndāvana, Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa do not generally think or feel that Their separation lasts for long. Śrīmatī Rādhikā’s mood is this: “I am here at Sūrya-kuṇḍa, and Kṛṣṇa is coming from Kusuma-sarovara; we will wait for Him.” Or, She is in <i>māna</i>. Vṛṣabhānu-nandinī Rādhikā does not think, “Kṛṣṇa has gone to Mathurā and Dvārakā.” She embraces the <i>tamāla</i> trees, talking and laughing with them, thinking, “Oh, Kṛṣṇa is here!” She decorates Herself and acts as though He were present. In this way, She lives in Vṛndāvana and never goes anywhere else.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> There are two manifestations of this complete and original feature of Rādhikā as the daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu and Kīrtidā-devī. One manifestation is <i>saṁyoginī</i> Rādhā, who has the mood of meeting Kṛṣṇa at Kurukṣetra, and the other is <i>viyoginī</i> Rādhā, who is immersed in a spirit of separation. Saṁyoginī Rādhā has a relatively submissive, rightist (dakṣiṇa) mood, whereas viyoginī Rādhā has a more contrary, leftist (vāmya) mood. It is saṁyoginī Rādhā who goes to Kurukṣetra and meets Kṛṣṇa there, and viyoginī Rādhā who goes to Sūrya-loka.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Everything that I have explained here regarding these three features of Śrīmatī Rādhikā should be remembered when hearing, reading, or recalling any pastime of Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa; only in this way is it possible to understand these pastimes.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <b><u>Comparison of three aspects of Rādhārāṇī and Mahāprabhu</u></b></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīla Gurudeva's revealed to us that the three aspects of Mahāprabhu in Navadvīpa, Purī and Kavaur on the bank of the Godāvarī are comparable to three aspects of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī in Vṛndāvana, Uddhava-kyārī (Nandagrāma) and Kurukṣetra. He spoke as follows:</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> This mood of transcendental madness is of <i>Viyoginī</i> Rādhikā, and this is compared to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Purī. <i>Śrī Caitanya Caritāmṛta</i> explains that the mood of Śrīmatī Rādhikā which was seen by Uddhava was the constant mood of Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Gambhīrā.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>"Vṛndāvanam parityaja na padaṁ ekaṁ gacchati."</i> Kṛṣṇa never leaves Vṛndāvana. Nandanandana is always in Vṛndāvana. Vṛṣabhānu-nandini also never leaves Vṛndāvana, and similarly Śacīnandana never leaves Navadvīpa.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In Godāvarī, Caitanya Mahāprabhu manifested his <i>Rasarāja-mahābhāva svarūpa</i>. There in Godāvarī He discussed all <i>tattvas</i>: <i>rasa-tattva, prema-tattva, </i>and<i> rādhā-tattva</i>. But who saw this? Only Rāmānanda Rāya. This manifestation of <i>Rasarāja-mahābhava</i> was not an ordinary activity. No one else could have shown Himself as Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is an opulence; therefore is <i>aiśvarya</i>, and it is not the highest <i>līlā</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Śrīmatī Rādhikā’s partial moods and forms are included within Her original form, and this is also true with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In Mahāprabhu's <i>līlā</i>, Purī is like Dvārakā. When He is in Gambhīrā (the room where Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed in Purī), He is experiencing Rādhārāṇī’s separation from Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā, in the mood of <i>Viyoginī</i> Rādhikā. When Mahāprabhu is in Godāvarī, He is like <i>Saṁyoginī</i> Rādhikā. This aspect of Śrīmatī Rādhikā meets Kṛṣṇa at Kurukṣetra in order to bring Him back to Vṛndāvana. These two aspects of Mahāprabhu are included in Navadvīpa.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Jaya Srila Gurudeva!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> <i>Tridandi-biksu</i> <br> Bhaktivedanta Visnudaivata</p> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/contact" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
