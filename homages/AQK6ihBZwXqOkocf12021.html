Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja and my beloved Gurudeva Srila Narayana Gosvami Maharaja.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Dandavat pranams. I am Ananga Mohini Devi Dasi (Maiya) from Holland. I would like to share a few pastimes with Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaj and Srila Gurudeva with you in honour of the centennial year 2021 of Srila Gurudeva.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> Experience with Srila Gour Govinda Maharaj before meeting Srila Narayana Gosvami Maharaj.</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The first sadhu I met in my life in 1994 was Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja. At that time we were still in ISKCON. We came to know that an exalted sadhu was coming. We knew nothing about a pure sadhu and had many questions and became very curious about him. I asked a devotee for background information about Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja. My heart began to melt upon hearing the glories of him and also when I learnt that he was coming to our house for programs and would stay with us. The strong desire to receive and serve Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja in our home developed in my heart. I began to inquire from devotees the best way to prepare the visit of such a great personality at our home . My desire to receive Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja became so intense that l could hardly wait for that day. Since a devotee had indicated that it was customary to give a flower garland to Maharaja upon receiving him, I made a very long beautiful flower garland. With my family and some devotees I went to Brussels Airport to receive Maharaja. All those present started chanting the mahamantra at the airport. After a while, the gate door finally opened and we were delighted to see Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja approaching us in a wheelchair. He was brought on a wheelchair as his feet were a bit troubled. My first look at him made me feel as if the sun and the moon had come together in front of me. Maharaja ji was so attractive. My heart immediately started to melt and I was very impressed to receive darshan from Maharaja ji. I went very close to him to put the mala around his neck. He accepted the mala and looked straight into my eyes. All those present also had brought nice flowermalas. Very soon his neck was covered with many big flowermalas. It was so beautiful to watch this. While Maharaja proceeded further on his wheelchair, we followed him to the car that would take him to Belgium for <i>harikatha</i> gathering. Before his car drove off, Maharaja ji very lovingly gave me the same flowermala that I put around his neck. Tears flowed from my eyes at the sight of his mahamala in my hands. I took this mala at home and dried it in a box and I still keep this mala at my house. I still keep the towel that dried his feet</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I first met Syamarani Didi and Vrindavilasi Didi who are disciples of Swami Maharaja at our house. They came to our house for program of Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja. When Maharaja ji arrived at our residence, I sprinkled roses on him . When I saw Syamarani Didi I felt that they both were very special souls. We had made much prasadam and Srila Gour Govinda Maharaja had delivered a very powerful hari katha at our residence. Maharaja ji was very pleased by our seva to him. Each day I had the opportunity to wash and iron his clothes. I was very happy to do seva for him. Before leaving our home to continue his journey to India, Maharaja ji gave me a very beautiful blessing in front of my children. He said that from now on we will receive frequently lots of sadhus at our home. I accepted the blessing with lots of love. Until now every year sadhus regularly come and stay at our residence. Only this year because of Corona infection, sadhus cannot yet travel to The Netherlands. But this is going to be fine. After he left for India, my eldest son made a decision to also go to India to do seva for Maharaja ji in Bubhaneswar Ashram. Painful situation I had to face as I struggled to give permission to my son who wanted to leave for India at a young age. I just cried out of grief. I thought how can I send him to a country where we had never been. My son Vidjay wanted to leave to India together with two prabhus from the Netherlands who had already been in India. Yet it was so hard for me to make a decision. My son became very sad when I did not give permission. At the end I gave permission. I thought I'd leave everything to Sri Guru and Krishna. Then the day came when my son would leave us. I got very very sad to say goodbye to him. I cried every day after he left. Almost every day I would call him to hear his voice. But Vijay replied that he really liked to be with Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja there in Bubhaneswar. He liked to hear <i>harikatha</i> every day and also to do seva. Vidjay said "Ma ,Try to sell everything in The Netherlands, you should all come and live here." But one day we received a very bad news. We were told the heartbreaking news that Srila Gour Govinda Maharaja had gone into aprakat lila. I became very upset with this news together with my children. I just thought that everything was going so well with Maharaja ji's health. This news was very hard for me and my children. I was unable to go to Bubhaneswar at ashort notice to attend his samadhi ceremony. But my daughter Syamabiharini who is a disciple of Maharaja ji was able to quickly arrange her departure to Bubaneshwar. After Maharaja ji's samadhi I spoke to my son to return to The Netherlands. But my son indicated that if he would come back to The Netherlands then he was afraid to get into the lap of Maya. After this I had a serious conversation with my daughter Syamabiharini to have my son come back to The Netherlands. Eventually he came back and once he was at our house I convinced him to finish his studies. Then he finished his studies.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> Experiences with Srila Gurudeva Narayana Gosvami Maharaja In the year 1996</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Three months after Srila Gour Govinda Maharaja went into aprakat lila, one day we received a message that another exalted sadhu was coming to The Netherlands. We had not yet got over the grief of Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja, but I decided with my family to receive him at Schiphol Amsterdam Airport. I went to Amsterdam Airport with my family and we were waiting at the arrival hall for Srila Gurudeva Narayana Gosvami Maharaja. Srila Gurudeva had to arrive with his group. Suddenly, we saw Srila Gurudeva coming out into the arrival hall. Me and my family immediately had the same feelings for Srila Gurudeva that we experienced with Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja. Srila Gurudeva was very attractive with his enchanting smile. We had brought very beautiful long flower mala, the same style flower mala we made for Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja, for receiving Srila Gurudeva. The appearance of Srila Gurudeva was very special. We hoped immediately he would initiate us. We absolutely loved him. At his first look, I felt that Srila Gurudeva had the same mood and radiance as Srila Gour Govinda Maharaja. It was a very nice welcome of Srila Gurudeva in The Netherlands. At the first darshan we asked Srila Gurudeva to initiate us. He immediately said I have accepted you and your children and I will take you to Sri Vrindavan dhama. I thought with my family what a beautiful grace we had received. We lived in The Hague and had a program in The Hague. Every day I was preparing with my children prasadam for Srila Gurudeva and the devotees present. When Srila Gurudeva found out that we were cooking, he gave us so much blessings. He asked me if we had prepared all the prasadam. We ourselves had not told Srila Gurudeva that we were going to prepare prasadam. Srila Gurudeva became very happy seeing all the prasadam preparations and gave us so much blessings. Thus Srila Gurudeva came into our lives and the words of Srila Gour Govinda Maharaja came true in a short time. When Srila Gour Govinda Maharaja came to our home, Syamarani Didi had come to us. And when Srila Gurudeva came to us in The Netherlands, Syamarani Didi again came to our residence.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva invited us to Vrajamandal parikrama. We were happy with the invitation. I went to India with my children. It was our very first trip to New Delhi. From there we travelled by taxi straight to Mathura where Srila Gurudeva was waiting for us. We received <i>harinama</i> mantra in The Netherlands and received <i>diksa</i> mantra in Mathura. And my daughter Rasapriya received both initiation on the same day in Mathura. At our first visit in 1996, we got in our hands our Deities Sri Radha Vinod Bihariji from Srila Gurudeva. From 1996 onwards we went to Vrajamandel parikrama every year and joined from 1997 Gaur Purnima parikrama. In between during Puroshottam month we were also with Srila Gurudeva in Sri Jaganath Puri. We had good times with Srila Gurudeva, even though the parikrama period was tough, because we got sick each time due to our primitive stay. Despite this inconvenience, we did not miss the parikrama for a year. When we saw Srila Gurudeva we forgot about the heavy parikrama.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Since 1996, we have received darshan from Srila Gurudeva every three months in India and European countries. He also came to stay two to three times a year at our residence. Many times, Srila Gurudeva secretly came to our house for writing or for rest and recovering during his sickness. Srila Gurudeva sometimes did not allow us to inform any devotees of his arrival in The Netherlands. Sometimes it seemed like it was a dream that Srila Gurudeva was staying with us, as no one else except my family was with Srila Gurudeva. I just want to hope this wasn't a dream. We liked to do his seva and saw this as pure grace from Srila Gour Govinda Gosvami Maharaja because very shortly after his departure an exalted personality came in our lives. Sometimes my house was full of devotees from abroad, who came for Srila Gurudeva. Gurudeva really enjoyed watching Ramayana and Mahabharat with us. Once while watching, he told my daughter Sashikala not to enter in Mahabharat. He was comparing married life with Mahabharat. He said that married life seems to be a lot of fun, but this brings so many problems. They look happy, but in real they are not happy. He indicated to her that he did not want her to get married in the future. He told her that she should not enter into Mahabharat. He meant to say that she should not get married in this life. Srila Gurudeva has told me that I should never force Sashikala to get married. He said he was going to take care of her and that I should absolutely not worry about her. He confirmed to me that even if I was gone, he would take care of her. After these instructions from Srila Gurudeva, I was no longer worried about her future and left everything up to Srila Gurudeva. I still notice that Sashikala is protected by Srila Gurudeva. We should therefore not take Srila Gurudeva's instructions and predictions lightly.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In the time of Srila Gurudeva, on each Ekadasi I observed nirjala Ekadasi together with Sashikala, just so that Srila Gurudeva would live for a very long time. We had no trouble doing full fast each Ekadasi for Srila Gurudeva's health. We have experienced loads of pastimes with Srila Gurudeva. This is too much to mention. In every house where we moved in The Netherlands, Srila Gurudeva has stayed in each of our house during his visits. One of the nicest pastimes I am going to tell you now how Sri Giriraja came to us. Once we went to Vrajamandal parikrama and arrived in Govardhan. In Govardhan we were always happy. I always tell everyone that Govardhan is in my heart. I decided with my daughter Sashikala to live in Govardhan and wanted to move from The Netherlands to Govardhan. We planned darshan with Srila Gurudeva and walked into his room. Srila Gurudeva asked us how we are doing. Sashikala told Srila Gurudeva about our plans to live in Govardhan. Srila Gurudeva looked very seriously in our eyes and said ‘Your seva is in Holland. Who else will otherwise take care of my Sannyasis and the devotees in The Netherlands? 'Srila Gurudeva said in a serious voice that he himself is not staying long in India and travelling all over the world. He said that especially when it is too hot and too cold he is abroad. If you stay in The Netherlands you will see me several times. We watched Srila Gurudeva very quietly because he didn’t approve our plan.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Once, Srila Gurudeva stayed with us for deven days. On the last day he said our house had become Vrindavan. He said we have a very nice altar. But something is missing in this. We asked Srila Gurudeva what was missing on the altar. He said with a smiling face, "Sri Giriraj. Surprised we said to Srila Gurudeva that during Vrajamandal parikrama you are instructing everyone not to take even a small Giriraja Sila from Govardhan, or we should put the same weight of gold in the same place by removing Giriraja. Srila Gurudeva then replied with a laugh "very soon Giriraja will come to you" and then returned to the stairs to proceed to his room with a smile. From that day onwards, our desire was even more fueled to serve Giriraja. I told my daughter Sashikala that we were going to experience a miracle as I had deep faith that Srila Gurudeva's words would soon come true and we would soon be allowed to serve Giriraja. In the same year I took my daughter to Vrajamandal parikrama.There, Srila Gurudeva instructed everyone not to take any Giriraj Sila. He also instructed everyone to walk carefully during Govardhan parikrama to avoid touching Giriraja Sila. During the Vrajamandel parikrama we thought we would get a Govardhan Sila from Srila Gurudeva, but the parikrama almost came to an end. We still didn’t receive Govardhan Sila. On the last day of the parikrama Sashikala went to Srila Gurudeva after the morning harikatha to ask if we were going to get Giriraja before we leave for Holland. Srila Gurudeva looked at her very seriously and said "You want to serve Giriraja? You better serve Sri Radha Krishna." Srila Gurudeva's response became very confusing to Sashikala. But I reassured her that the blessing of serving Sri Giriraja would surely come true one day.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Parikrama ended and we had to return to Holland. We packed our bags and before leaving we wanted to say goodbye to Srila Gurudeva. Sripad Madhava Maharaja indicated that Srila Gurudeva was honoring prasadam and we had to wait a little longer. Suddenly Srila Gurudeva's door opened while he was honoring prasadam. He looked at us very sweetly and signaled us to enter in his room. The best prasadam he had on his plate was dokhla and he gave it to us. The dokhla was warm and very soft and tasted very good. This darshan of Srila Gurudeva in his room was the most beautiful darshan for us and the pinnacle of this parikrama. We thanked Sripad Madhava Maharaja for allowing us in the room of Srila Gurudeva. When we got back to The Netherlands we went to the Sunday program. At the end of the program we spoke with Sita didi who was a new devotee. We told her how we celebrated Govardhan puja in India. We described her our experiences. We then asked her how they had celebrated Diwali and Govardhan puja in The Netherlands. She then said that they celebrated Govardhan puja very well in The Netherlands with Giriraja. I asked her in amazement who had brought Giriraja to the Sunday program. Sita didi informed me and Sashikala that she had taken Giriraja into the temple on Govardhan puja day, but that no one had asked her questions from where she got Giriraja. She began to tell her story of how she had taken Giriraja from Govardhan. She had gone to Govardhan alone to do parikrama. Then her eyes fell on a nice smooth Govardhan Sila. Without realizing that this was a Govardhan Sila she placed the Sila in her handbag with the thoughts of what to do with it later in The Netherlands as she was an artist. She didn't know anything about Sri Giriraja's glories yet. Not knowing that she was not allowed to take Govardhan Sila from Goveadhan, she did parikrama from Govardhan with the Govardhan Sila in her handbag. After this she went to Navadvipa dhama for parikrama and then she went to Jagannath Puri with the Govardhan Sila in her handbag all the time. After visiting Jagannath Puri she arrived in The Netherlands. The Netherlands and Holland is the same country. With the thought and not knowing that she had taken the Govardhan Sila, she placed the Sila outside in her garden among her collection of other types of garden ornamental stones. It was autumn weather in The Netherlands. In the night she had a dream. In the dream she saw that the stone was feeling very cold. The next day she took the stone inside. Since she believed that the stone came from a sacred dhama, she had placed the stone on her altar nearby Laddu Gopal after the dream, because she believed the stone was from the sacred dhama. The next evening she had another dream from the stone. This time she saw in her dream that the stone wanted milk. Since she had Laddu Gopal on the altar, she eventually put milk near the stone and with the thought that Laddu Gopal also wanted milk. That night she dreamt that the stone was having cold. When she woke up she thought she was going mad seeing such dreams from the stone.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> The next day she saw a silk cloth. She wrapped it around the Sila. Then next day she had another dream that the stone would stare at her with wide eyes. She woke up the next morning and exactly how she had painted the eyes and other details she had seen on the Sila. After this she wondered if the stone wasn't a Govardhan Sila after all. She thought the stone looked like the Govardhan Silas she had seen in the temples in Govardhan. The next day Govardhan puja was supposed to be in Holland and she was inspired to take the Sila to the temple to find out if she hadn't taken Giriraja Sila after all with her to Holland. On Govendhan puja day she took the Sila to the temple, but no one asked her from where she had brought the Sila. The pujari took the Sila from her and placed the Sila on the altar. This immediately confirmed her that the stone was Giriraja Sila. On that day, the devotees had prepared many dishes for Goverdhan puja. Giriraj aeventually ate all the many dishes from the altar. Sita told this story to me and Sashikala when we met her during the temple program. Shasi replied that none of Srila Gurudeva is allowed to take a Govardhan Sila home from Goverdhan. Not even a very small one. Otherwise you have to put the same amount of weight of gold at same spot. Sashikala told her that Srila Gurudeva would not be pleased to hear that this Sila has now been brought to The Netherlands. Sita indicated that she did not known that she was not allowed to bring Sila from the dhama to The Netherlands. She told us that she did not have the qualities to be pujari for Sri Govardhan Sila. Sashikala replied her that she should write Srila Gurudeva of what exactly had happened. Instead of writing in person the letter to Srila Gurudeva, she came to our home the next day with the Giriraja Sila and rang the doorbell. Sashikala opened the door. Sita placed the Govardhan Sila in her hands. Sita told Sashikala that she had now handed over the Giriraja Sila to her and all responsibilities for Sri Giriraj are hers and she left it to her to email Srila Gurudeva herself about the arrival of Sri Giriraja in Holland. If Srila Gurudeva is going to say that the Sila must return then you can bring the Giriraja Sila to him during Navadviap parikrama. Shasi fell completely in love with Sri Giriraj and immediately thought to keep this Giriraja Sila. She was thinking how to ask permission from Srila Gurudeva for this. Subsequently, Shasi sent an email to Srila Gurudev and reminded him what he predicted at our house that we had a beautiful altar, but that only Sri Giriraja is missing at our altar and very soon Sri Giriraja would come to us. She also wrote to Srila Gurudev that she was totally in love and would prefer to keep this Giriraja Sila, but that she would eventually follow his instruction and wrote that if he instructed her to bring Giriraja back she would anyway hand over this Sila to Srila Gurudeva. She wrote also that she would become sad but accept his instruction. Srila Gurudeva responded after three hours on the same day and said: ‘In this way Sri Giriraja came to you’. My heartfelt blessing are for you to serve Sri Giriraja and instructed her how to serve Sri Giriraja. Srila Gurudeva asked to take Giriraja Sila to Navadvipa parikrama. When we arrived in Sri Navadvipa dhama and had darshan of Srila Gurudeva, we showed Sri Giriraja to him. He immediately very affectionately took Sri Giriraja in his hands and recited a mantra for special blessing to us and also to make sure Sri Giriraja would not take any offense from us. After this, Srila Gurudeva handed Giriraja Sila to us. Sri Giriraja lila ki jaya.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> Vegetables for Srila Gurudeva to Italy</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> At all European festivals, we provided vegetables for the entire festival for Srila Gurudeva. We brought large quantities by plane or car. One day there would be a festival in Italy. We were bringing fresh Surinamese vegetables for Srila Gurudeva for the whole week in all European countries. We communicated with the devotees who would travel with us that we had many vegetables and requested each to keep a space in their suitcase. It took time to properly distribute the vegetables among the devotees at Schiphol Airport. Some were also not on time at the mentioned time at Schiphol Airport, so we had to wait for them, otherwise we would have too much overweight. Besides we had already checked-in our luggage. Just before luggage check-in was about to close, they arrived running at the luggage check-in at last moment. What I haven't told you yet is that Srimati Uma Didi would be traveling with us. My daughter would accompany Uma Didi with walking because she was unable to walk alone. Ranga Didi was not travelling with Uma Didi at that time. The boarding of the plane had already started, so the devotees who arrived late began to run to customs control and quickly run to the gate to board the plane. Me and my daughter Sashikala were left behind with Uma Didi. We could not run with the rest of the devotees because Uma Didi herself was slow in walking and we had to accompany her all the way to the airplane. We started walking with Uma Didi to the gate and at the same time praying to Sri Krishna and meditating on Srila Gurudeva to allow us to fly with the same airplane. If we would have missed the plane, then we wouldn't be able to leave for Italy for a few days. It was important for us to fly with this flight, because most important vegetables for Srila Gurudeva were checked in under our name. Srila Gurudeva would not have enough vegetables for many days we would not fly over to Italy on time. In Italy the vegetables which Srila Gurudeva was using was not available there. Praying and with much tension we walked with Uma Didi to the departing gate. What happened then.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> When we were halfway to the gate we heard announcement that due to technical problem the plane had been delayed for two hours. With great relief I walked with my daughter and Uma Didi the other half of the route to the gate very relaxed. We walked with tears of joy and very grateful that our prayer had been answered to travel to Italy by the same plane, so that Srila Gurudeva would have enough vegetables from the beginning of the festival. As we walked, we saw from a distance that no one had checked-in for entering into the plane at the scheduled time. We saw how all the devotees were still waiting for us at the gate to come. All the devotees along with Uma Didi found this what we had experience to be a very special event. When we arrived in Italy, Srila Gurudeva was waiting for us. I, my daughter Sashikala and Uma Didi were called to the building of Srila Gurudeva. All the vegetables we had brought for him. Srila Gurudeva wanted to see and touch each item we brought. We saw how he took all the kinds of vegetables one by one in his hand and looked at us with great satisfaction. We reflected our experience to Srila Gurudeva in detail. Srila Gurudeva listened very sweetly with a beautiful smile to our story. After telling our adventure to Srila Gurudeva, he said he wanted us to be with him from the beginning of the festival.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> Srila Gurudeva's protection as Nrshrimhadeva</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudev as Nrshrimhadeva is in our heart. Srila Gurudeva is in our hearts.<br>He guides everything, he gives us strength in everything.<br></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> He had instructed us at our residence that we should be tolerant like Prahlad Maharaja, although when you will experience obstacles, you must endure everything and I will come to you as Nrshrimhadeva to rescue you. He had instructed us in our home that we should be tolerant like Prahlad Maharaj, although you experience obstacles, you must endure everything and I will come to you as Nrshrimhadeva to rescue you.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> We had faced many obstacles in the past. But we always remained calm. <br>Even now, every time when we face obstacles, we experience that the obstacles are very quickly removed by Srila Gurudeva. He mitigates and softenes the situation. Srila Gurudeva knows exactly what he is doing. We have complete faith in Srila Gurudeva's words. We have full confidence in the words of Srila Gurudeva. Despite not being able to get physical darshan from Srila Gurudeva, I feel like he is always with us. Although we can not have physical darshan of Srila Gurudeva, I feel that he is always with us.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Srila Gurudeva had also previously told us at home that he carries our family in his pocket and takes us everywhere he goes. I have embraced all this grace and I always want to keep following his instructions.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> Bhagavad Gita (BG) Seminars in The Netherlands</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Since my son Vijay is giving BG seminars, many people come to attend the seminars. Those who have sukriti become attracted and begin to follow the rules and begin to do seva. We regularly invite sanyasis of Srila Gurudeva and these new persons who have attended the BG seminar are attracted to bhakti yoga and take initiation from these sadhus who are invited to Holland. These sadhus who come to us offer these persons as flowers to Srila Gurudeva and what is quite remarkable is that the behavior and heart of these new persons are changing. You see that so many people after following our BG seminar programs have a frame with photo of Srila Gurudev and guruparampara on their altar at home and do arati for them and now prepare tasty vedic dishes without garlic and union and honoring prasadam. All these people become devotees and they call me Maiya, because Srila Gurudeva started calling me Maiya from the beginning he saw me. We give all these devotees love and affection and the necessary education so that they can more and more become seriously and make spiritual advancement. All these developments in The Netherlands happened with the blessing of Srila Gurudeva. Now we realize with the family why he did not allow us to live in Govardhan. If we were to live there, we would never be able to offer all these persons the necessary support to make spiritual progress. Srila Gurudeva knows present, past and future. This is clearly noticeable through his predictions.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> European festivals together with Srila Gurudeva</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> At each festival I was looking for the opportunity to cook in the kitchen for Srila Gurudeva, Sometimes I cooked in a small kitchen, sometimes I went to assist Sripad Vana Maharaj with cooking for Srila Gurudeva. In the beginning I was observing how Sripad Vana Maharai was cooking for Srila Gurudeva and also assisted him in the kitchen. They liked that I loved the opportunity to help them cook for Srila Gurudeva. During European festivals we rented houses with kitchens close to Srila Gurudeva to cook for him. Uma Didi stayed with us in the house together with Ranga didi. We often went to cook for Srila Gurudeva and the Sanyasis together with Uma Didi in our holiday house. I also went with my daughter Sashikala in the holiday house, where Srila Gurudeva stayed, to cook during European festivals. Many times Sripad Vana Maharaj and Sripad Sridhar Maharaj came to our holiday house to honor prasadam together with Uma Didi during the festivals. We had a large dining table and it was so nice to have them together in our house and to join their conversations. Once while in Italy, we had a room without a kitchen for cooking. Gurudeva asked us to cook for him during this festival. We were in a dilemma how to cook for him. To our luck, a devotee suddenly arrived with a large caravan with inside a small kitchen. I asked the devotee ,who owned the caravan, if we could cook for Srila Gurudeva and sadhus in his kitchen. He said, "Off course you can cook in my caravan". Devotees very quickly brought tables to the caravan for us to sort the utensils, vegetables, herbs, water and all other cooking necessities. Outside on the table, vegatables were cut and washed by devotees and I managed to cook in the small kitchen together with Sashikala. The sanyasis, Uma Didi and Srila Gurudeva were very happy with the prasadam we prepared for them. Sripad Madhava Maharaj and Van Maharaj also were cooking for Srila Gurudeva in a small kitchen. I didn't want to disturb them to cook there too. What I was going to make were extra dishes for Gurudeva. And for the sanyasis and Uma Didi we were preparing complete prasadam. We received mahaprasadam of Srila Gurudeva every day to honor.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> Adventure in Germany with Tungavidia didi from Gopinath Bhavan </h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Once we celebrated European festival in Germany in winter season. The area of the festival was covered with snow and it was very cold outside. Tungavidia didi from Gopinath Bhavan had come from India. We both went to do seva for Gurudeva. Once we wanted to walk outside during a rest day. There was a thick layer of snow everywhere. We thought that since everyone was resting so let us go out for a short walk in the snow. I got along very well with Tungavidia didi. We were walking in the snow together and had nice conversations about Srila Gurudeva. She, from her side, was telling her experiences and I was also sharing the experiences with Srila Gurudeva from my point of view and before we knew it was a long walk and we were far away from the location of the festival. Suddenly we realized that we had to cook for Srila Gurudeva. We looked at the watch and were shocked to find out that we had less time left to cook for Srila Gurudeva. We were in a dilemma what to do, because our building ,where we were going to cook for Srila Gurudeva, was opposite of the large hill. Not too high, but still quite high. During our conversation we had walked around the hill. To be back on time for Srila Gurudeva cooking would not be possible if we would return from the same route. We came to the conclusion that the only solution would be to climb over the hill and descend down to reach the building for cooking on time. That the hill was covered with snow, but at that time we thought it was possible to climb over the hill to take this short route and then let us lower down on the other side. We started to climb the hill. It went well despite the snow. The higher we climbed the more surprised we became, as we encountered no snow but only slippery ice on which we had to walk. The hill went up steeply and at some point we started to slide back. Here and there twigs were visible on the mountain. To reduce sliding and to push ourselves up, we held on the twigs. But some of the twigs broke off and we both slid down again. Again we tried to lift ourselves up and used the twigs to uplift us again. Some of the sprigs were firm but some were not. Some twigs broke off. We both wore sari. Finally we started to support each other to get to the top of the hill. I was not wearing boots, but normal shoes. While we were climbing up, one of my shoes got out of my feet and fell down. My shoe was out and I couldn't take it back. I just kept climbing. We both reached the top of the hill with great difficulty. From above we saw the building where we had to cook for Srila Gurudeva.We now had to go down the other side of the hill. We held hands and let ourselves down. To our relief, we reached downstairs soon and quickly walked frozen, due to the cold, into the building. We both immediately walked to our own room to take a hot shower and to wear warm clothes. To our relief we got back just on time to cook for Srila Gurudeva. No one noticed our adventure. Later Tungavidia didi started telling this adventure to my daughter Sashikala. Full of amazement with wide eyes and open mouth she was listening to what we experienced. From that day onwards, she kept an eye on us each day to prevent us from having another adventure together. Still when I and Tungavidia didi are together we talk about this adventure of Germany again.</p> <h3 class="ce-header"> Srila Gurudeva's sickness lila</h3> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In 2010, Srila Gurudeva's sickness lila occurred. When Srila Gurudeva was at this time in Raman Vihari Goudiya Math in Delhi, we developed a desire to be near Srila Gurudeva. I then went with my children to this Math where Srila Gurudeva was staying. We also stayed at the same Math in Delhi for a few days. We had to get used to for not having darshan of Srila Gurudeva. From time to time the servants would bring him to the doorand outside ,the devotees gathered together for chanting and doing kirtan for Srila Gurudeva. We saw only a glimpse of Srila Gurudeva, but for us was important that Srila Gurudeva would get better soon. We were pleased to learn that my daughter Sashikala had received special darshan from Srila Gurudeva in Srila Gurudeva's room in the presence of Sripad Vana Maharaj. Sashikala described to us all her experiences with Srila Gurudeva in his room and especially how he blessed her. She began to cry when she saw Srila Gurudeva in his sickness lila, because she was not used to see him like that. When Sashikala started to cry, Srila Gurudeva, who was laying down flat on his back with his eyes closed, suddenly sat straight on his bed and talked to her as if nothing was wrong. She said that Srila Gurudeva was speaking to her smiling very sweetly and his body was shining so brightly. She told that he spoke to her with different kind of lanquage. The language he spoke was unfamiliar to her. Since 1996, Srila Gurudeva has been coming to our residence to stay, but she never heard him talk like this before. She thought this must have been a samadhi language. She saw Srila Gurudeva smiling very beautifully and he looked not sick at all. With his right hand he gave her blessing. Sashikala got realization at this point that Srila Gurudeva was not suffering, but that he was just doing his sickness lila. Moments later when Sashikala related these events to us, we were more reassured. After this we went to Govardhan. Srila Gurudeva was brought to Govardhan by ambulance from Sri Raman Bihari Goudiya Math. We often got to see Srila Gurudeva on a large LCD screen in the hall together with the devotees present, sometimes Srila Gurudeva was suddenly brought on wheelchair to the door of his room to bless us. In this way I remember the good times with Srila Gurdeva that we carry in our heart like jewels.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Jaya Srila Gurudeva!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Your loving daughter</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Ananga Mohini Devi Dasi</p> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/contact" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
