iti namine</i></p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I offer my humble obeisances at the lotus feet of my beloved Gurudeva, Sri Srimad Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> My name is Tarun Tamal Dasa from Germany. My wife‘s name is Sumukhi Dasi. The names of our children are Cayana-Manjari Dasi, Akhileshvari Dasi, Radharani Dasi and Krsna Das. Srila Gurudeva Narayana Maharaja is our eternal master, our beloved father, our dear friend, and true well-wisher.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Although it is most likely to happen that due to my bad character I will feel some pride in writing such an offering to Srila Gurudeva, thinking of myself of being some kind of true disciple, pretending to be of some qualification, yet I am writing for one reason. I have to leave my doubts behind. There is a reason to give up my hesitance. I want to serve Srila Gurudeva and do what I can to assist in fullfilling His <i>mano-bhistam</i>. This is to spread the message of Sri Rupa Goswami and Sri Raghunatha Goswami.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> When I was 16 years old, a friend of mine gave me Srila Prabhupada's Bhagavad-Gita. After reading the introduction of the Gita with melting heart and tears in remembrance of what I had forgotten since my last life, I had only one desire from that day on: I wanted to be with Srila Prabhupada and give my whole life to him. When I found out after a year or so that he has left this world‘s external vision when I was just a baby of one year of age in my spiritual life, my life lost all purpose, all hope, and the darkness, that surrounded me before receiving the Bhagavad-Gita, was back again all of a sudden. Those days, back in 1992 or 1993, there was no way to get instant information like today.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> My plan to go and meet with Srila Prabhupada became impossible, and I cried, I was devastated. Then, somehow I received a copy of "Prabhupada-Lila“, a biography-like book written by one of His disciples. More books like this followed, called "Prabhupada Nectar“ and "Prabhpada <i>Lilamrita</i>“. These books consisted mainly of small chapters, wherein His disciples shared their remembrances with their beloved spiritual Master. What can I say? By reading these books, again and again, I had association with Srila Prabhupada through the remembrances of His disciples. This experience is a reality for me, it is ongoing every time I read these books again, and unlimited happiness and hope floods my heart that I may come close to Him in this way. Therefore it is my duty to assist Srila Gurudeva in His mission to reach out to all souls in this world with the message of love of godhead, by writing about my remembrances of meeting with Him. One day I will forget them due to old age, or I will die without having told these things, through which others can meet with Srila Gurudeva and receive His love in their hearts, just as I have received Srila Prabhupada's love through the remembrances of His dear disciples. As this process worked for me, no matter how advanced or well-known the writers have been, I assume that it will also work when I will write, despite of my being unworthy. I would like to say that I am nothing but a worm in the stool, as Srila Trivkrama Maharaj is able to express His humility, but as I am not humble until now, I can only say I am unworthy. Otherwise, pride will enter my heart even more, and there is nothing that I fear more than pride, which comes from hankering for name and fame, although my whole thinking is filled by pride and false ego from top to bottom.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Yet, some miraculous beauty has entered my life and has decorated even a person like myself, and whenever I see this beauty, shining out of my heart and dispelling all darkness of ego and bad character, I find myself beeing blessed by Srila Gurudeva's presence, which has entered me in the form of His mercy by accepting me in His family.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Let me therefore share how I had met with Srila Gurudeva, Srila Narayana Gosvami Maharaja, whom I desire to follow for all times yet to come. Other than that, I am not able to make any offering. The remembrance of Srila Gurudeva is the only thing of value and purity, that I possess. I am glorifying Him by means of what He Himself has given to me, His love, attention and affection.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ***</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I left home after school in order to search for association of true followers of Srila Prabhupada, praying to him daily that this may happen. So, due to His guidance, after one year I became friend with Ram Shraddha Prabhu and Janaki-devi Mataji. He is Srila Prabhupada's disciple, and he has met with Srila Gurudeva on the day of Srila Prabhupada's <i>samadhi</i> ceremony. Srila Gurudeva was leading the <i>nagara-sankirtan</i> in Vrindavan, and Ram Shraddha Prabhu was one of the two young <i>brahmacaris</i> to lead the party with <i>mrdanga</i>.<br> I worked in the family’s incense company as a student also, and in 1998 Prabhu told me: "You stay here and take care of the business. I will go to Italy to meet with a great <i>sadhu</i>. After a week, I may come back.“</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> When he came back, he told me: "I have never heard such a thing. Even the youngest amongst his followers are able to speak and sing in such a way that it by far surpasses everything that I have experienced since Srila Prabhupada was present.“ Prabhu is an extraordinarily good singer and speaker himself, so I was astonished to hear him speak like this. Moreover, a miracle has taken place, Prabhu has kept beautiful deities of Sri Sri Radha-Ramana in his home for many years, but they have never been installed, because in full awareness of <i>shastra’s</i> direction Prabhu prayed that only an <i>Uttama-Bhagavata</i> should invite the Lord to be present. Otherwise, he didn’t want Them to be installed, even if he had to wait until another lifetime. No one knew about these deities and about Prabhu's desire. He never expressed it to anyone. Yet, when Srila Gurudeva met Prabhu in Italy, He remebered Him after more than 20 years and He told him: "Next year I will come to your home in Heidelberg in Germany, and I will also install Sri Sri Radha-Ramana then on your altar.“ Understanding, that Srila Gurudeva saw Prabhu’s heart’s desire, whose life and soul is his beloved master Srila Prabhupada, I was overwhelmed as Srila Gurudeva's love flooded my heart for the first time, one year before I actually met Him for the first time.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ***</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> When Srila Gurudeva came to visit Germany in 1999, He kindly initiated me in the chanting of <i>Sri Harinama</i>. Also, he introduced me to <i>Gopal-Mantra,</i> in order to enable me to serve Sri Sri Radha-Ramana. At that time and until today, I was not able to follow all regulative principles at all times, but when I told Srila Gurudeva about it, He encouraged me to always chant and become strong. I was young in age and young in spirtual practice, so looking back to those days, I am thinking that I have missed out on so many opportunities to become a real <i>sevaka</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Many cannot imagine, how it was then. I want to share with you. It was like meeting with the most exalted Vaishnava you can imagine. Meeting with Srila Gurudeva was like meeting with pure love and affection, like standing in the shower of sunlight, it was the shower of love of God to be in His presence.<br> One afternoon in Holland, when I was about to pack my things back in the car as I had to leave for the next day's studies back in Heidelberg, Srila Gurudeva came to me and stood next to me, chanting, and looking how I was about to leave. He smiled lovingly, and yet, with very earnest face He asked me: "Are you leaving?“ I replied "Yes, Srila Gurudeva. I have to be at the university tomorrow.“ Then He asked me "Did you like it?“, and I said "Srila Gurudeva, it was so beautiful to be with you here and I liked it so much.“ Speaking like this, I felt it would be better to cut out my tongue and firmly hold on to Srila Gurudeva's lotus feet and never leave them again. But a fool that I am in effect, I told Him that I would prefer to go away to attend university classes. But Srila Gurudeva went on asking: "Will you come back next time to see me again?“ "Of course Srila Gurudeva, I will come back as soon as possible.“ When I said that, His face became shining and bright again and as if in great relief He blessed me with His hand and said "Oh, very good!“. I fell down to touch His feet, and He went on chanting, walking around the festival place, alone, as in those days maybe 40 to 50 devotees gathered in the festival site, a dutch farm in the country side. This was the second year after I met with Srila Gurudeva for the first time and shortly after that, hundreds and thousands of devotees came to meet with Him. Today, it is so sweet to remember how easy it was to speak with Srila Gurudeva directly in the beginning. He would even come and speak with me, out of His great concern for every <i>jiva</i>. His desire was that everyone should receive Mahaprabhus message and mercy.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> When Srila Gurudeva asked me and heard my answer that I will come again, He felt happy and gave me the understanding that going back to university now, but keeping the heart's desire to be with Sri Guru always, is a sacred plan. Therefore He blessed me as He knew, that what He had come to give had entered my heart and that I would never let it go again.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ***</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In the next years, when Srila Gurudeva travelled the world for so many times, Vaishanava <i>bhakti</i> festivals took place everywhere. Srila Gurudeva used to come to Germany every year, and He went to other places in Europe as well. At that time, I was still a student and my dear wife Sumukhi Dasi had given birth to our second child. Sumukhi had received <i>diksha</i> five years before me, as her <i>adhikar</i> is much more developed than mine. In most beautiful steadiness she went on practicing <i>arcana</i> and <i>sadhana</i> and inspired me to follow her. Eventually, by her love, I became stronger to overcome those hindrances, that made me feel that I will not be able to receive <i>diksha</i>. The living of husband and wife is meant to serve each other by love and affection, and out of gratitude one will only desire the spiritual welfare and development of the other. Srila Gurudeva affectionately called Sumukhi "My dear darling daughter“, and He would accept so many of her offerings, understanding, that she often times prepared them in many months of work with firm dedication and true love. She sewed for Him, made first class almond paste, and other things. Due to this bondage between Srila Gurudeva and Sumukhi only had I the opportunity to come closer. Eventually, Srila Gurudeva initiated me into the <i>diksha</i> mantras in 2006. Before, I had written a letter to Him, indicating that after seven years of <i>Harinam</i> and following Him, I would be so happy if He would accept me as His disciple and that this was my only desire now. Srila Gurudeva replied, that He was so happy to hear that and that He would surely initiate me into <i>diksha</i> mantras when we would meet the next time. With this promise in my heart and mind, I came to Paderborn festival. I wanted to meet with Srila Gurudeva to receive <i>diksha</i> from Him. But it seemed impossible. In those days, masses of devotees wanted to meet with Him and baracading structures had to be developed to protect Him, to keep control over the situation. Easy access was not possible any longer. Only those who where very near to Srila Gurudeva always could walk in His quarters. It was a situation, that was not unknown to me, because it resembled exactly, what it was like when Srila Prabhupada was present. Understanding this, those early meetings with Srila Gurudeva, speaking to Him alone, or with only another devotee, or even with very few only, that was no longer possible now, hence became so much more valuable.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So I knocked the door, and a Sannyasi said: "No, you cannot recieve <i>diksha</i>.“ I replied: "Srila Gurudeva has promised to me!“ But seing my condition, no Tilak, no Dhoti, no shaven head, not chanting as much as 16 rounds, he simply said: "No. You are not qualified. You go away.“</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Since my first reading the Bhagava Gita as a 16 years old boy, determined to follow the path of the Vaishnavas, almost 14 years had passed at that time. And yet, again all my hope was broken, smashed to pieces, nothing left. The sannyasi was true indeed. I was not qualified. I am not qualified today. And as far as my understanding can reach, I don't see that I may become qulified until the end of my life. But yet, Srila Gurudeva had promised me, that He would accept my, and He was happy to do that. My first meeting with Him was, as I have told earlier, that He knew the heart of all, He knew the desires of the heart. Therefore I could not leave, although I have been sent away by a prominent disciple of His. I sat down on the floor, crying, and praying. Many devotees would go in and out Srila Gurudeva's rooms, and I did not kown what to do. I just sat there. How long, I don‘t know. I did not leave. Where should I go? Would all come to an end now? Then, what would life be all about? Why would Srila Prabhupada have lead me here, if now it would come to an end just when it was to really begin by the process of <i>diksha</i>? I could not accept that. The idea to leave seemed worse than dying on the spot. After some time Brajanath Prabhu, who is a receiver and ambassador of Srila Gurudeva's compassion, opened the door and asked me what I was waiting for. I told him that Srila Gurudeva had promised to give me <i>diksha</i>, but that I had been sent away due to my misqualification. Prabhu told me that Srila Gurudeva would be very happy to accept me and that I should come next morning at 6 am with shaven head and dhoti, prepared to be amongst those who would receive <i>diksha</i> mantras on the very next day.<br><br> So it happened. The fire ceremony was performed after Srila Gurudeva had given the sacred mantras to those who had approached Him, fleeing for His shelter. In the evening, just after the evening class in a huge hall filled with around 1000 devotees Srila Gurudeva anounced each and every name of that day's initiates. And then He spoke my name like this, "Tarun Tamal Prabhu ki jay“, lifting his eyebrows with a happy voice, lifting his arms in joy, for each and every name, and the crowd tuned in "Ki jay!“. <br><br> When Srila Gurudeva would leave the assembly halls in those days' festivals, hundreds of devotees formed a guard of honour, a row, just to be close to Srila Gurudeva when He went back to His room. It was not really possible to move in the crowd, so one had to have a strategy how to come close. Sometimes it was a risk, as it was not clear which way He would exactly come. The day of my initiation I decided to wait right next at one of the doors of the hall. It became clear after some minutes, that he would come this way, and I became so happy. All I wanted was to touch Srila Gurudevas lotus feet, to embrace Him in my heart. As it was so difficult to move at all, I bowed down quite some time before Srila Gurudeva reached that spot where I was waiting. I did not want to miss to touch His feet. Kneeling on the ground, being able just to see a short distance between so many devotees legs, I tried to see if Srila Gurudeva would come so close that I could possibly touch Him. And then it really happened. Srila Gurudeva came, and He stood there just long enough that I was able to touch His feet. Closing my eyes I held on as long as it was possible. Great joy entered my heart, as my life had now come to an all-auspicious point. All my fear of being rejected had vanished in this very moment, as I had become a legal candidate in Srila Gurudeva's school of <i>diksha</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> He had accepted me. So, after quite a while of kneeling down in this best of all positions for a <i>jiva</i> like me, having touched the sacred body of my beloved master, I somehow managed to stand up again. When I opened my eyes, Srila Gurudeva stood directly in front of me, looking straight and deeply into my eyes. He had waited for me all these seconds to stand up. These moments for me contained as much beauty and happiness to fill unlimited lifetimes. He blessed me with His hand and with a loving smile He said to me "Very good.“ Srila Gurudeva thus made me understand, that indeed He had waited for me to fulfill His promise to give me <i>diksha</i>. He Himself had made his dear disciple open the door for me. He Himself had accepted me. <br><br> From that day on, I consider my life to be successfull and myself to be an extraordinarily happy and wealthy man.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ***</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In 2007 Srila Gurudeva would had a stop-over in Frankfurt Airport in Germany. We packed our children at 2 am and headed 300 km for the Airport to meet with Him. Everything worked nicely and so we came there at around 5.30 am, just the time when Srila Gurudeva and His travelling party came out of the transit area, in that place, where it was possible to meet for Him with his disciples from Germany. Around 20 devotees had come at that early time of the day. It was for maybe one hour, that we were sitting next to Srila Gurudeva's lotus feet. From time to time, He would answer questions. At one point I asked, "Srila Gurudeva, it is so difficult to control my tongue, I cannot control my tongue. What can I do?“ My body is very much overweight and I am struggling since many years, not beeing able to find relief or a solution for that". So I thought, maybe if Srila Gurudeva would order me to fast or to reduce my food, then it would be a golden chance to overcome the habbit of overeating. Sripad Madhav Maharaj repeated my question loudly into Srila Gurudeva's ears in Hindi. Immediatley Srila Gurudeva smiled, He even loughed out and He said: "No harm. You can take <i>Mahaprasadam</i>.“ Not only me, but all devotees were astonished to understand how Srila Gurudeva would not at all consider bodily aspects. Whereas I thought of myself being as overweight, Srila Gurudeva's only concern was that I always keep safe in <i>bhakti</i>. Therefore, His advice for me was to make a sacred habit out of a bad habit: to accept <i>mahaprasada</i> only. In taking <i>Mahaprasada</i> only there is nothing bad left, and all other things such as regulation of the amount of food would be bound to follow very naturally in due course of time without any doubt. In this way Srila Gurudeva perfectly teached me, that for all problems, there is a positive answer, and that all kinds of what I may think is difficult or even <i>tapasya</i> begins with a positive approach in the direction of the sacred, which is a turnaround in the direction towards Sri Radha and Krsna and Their mercy.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In this way, Srila Gurudeva was able to turn a stupid and fully material question by a fool like me, who was and is unable to come forward with elevated questions, into spiritual answers. Moreover, He showed us how we can ourselves search for spiritual questions, which are the entry to the path of bhajana. Don’t get me wrong. It is not that I would understand all this at that moment. Nor do I understand all of Srila Gurudeva's answers by now. No, I did not understand. I understood this early morning sitting on the floor of Frankfurt Airport next to the lotus feet of a dear friend of Srila Prabhupada, that I am a hopeless case and Srila Gurudeva would only console me. Maybe that was also there. But what I understand for sure by now, that His answer has no limits. The only limit is my <i>shraddha</i>, my faith. What I want to say is, that even beginning from a foolish question, if one meditates upon Sri Guru's answer for a whole life time, then in that very answer, all answers and the whole hidden path of devotion may be contained, no matter how foolish the fool and how stupid his question.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ***</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> On one occasion, which I cannot clearly remember which place it was, Srila Gurudeva told me, that if I would not follow the path of <i>bhakti</i>, I would never be happy even though I make money. That seemed strange to me, because as a young student at that time, with family and children, severe lack of money was notorius for me. Therefore having some money did not seem the worst thing I could think about. Yet, I was confused about what Srila Gurudeva had told me.<br> Later in my life, it became obvious what Srila Gurudeva clearly saw at that time and what He warned me about. I completed my education, I found a well paid job as a government official, money came in and after some years money was not an issue any longer. I could fulfill my responsibilities as husband and father. But in the meantime, I had to leave behind youth and naivety. Clear signs of progressive age made me understand, that after a very short time, death would come and I would have to leave again. Thus it had come true for me that what I have heard from Srila Gurudeva so many times personally, that old age will come in no time. I was perplexed about it. Now, I myself could see, that in reality there was only one choice to make in a human's lifetime: am I going for spiritual health or material wealth? The only problem in life is: how will I find <i>bhakti</i>? How will I find a <i>Vaishnava</i>, who posesses that <i>bhakti</i> and who will grant me a space as an insigificant particle of dust at His lotus feet?</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> To be honest, it is with a sad heart that I have to confess here that due to my poor <i>adhikar</i> in bhakti I am until today very much concerned about money, material security and these things. Yet I am the happiest amongst men that by Srila Gurudeva's mercy alone, I may clearly and without any doubts feel and also understand how much I am wasting my time for it. I have clarity, Srila Gurudeva made it very clear to me.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So I keep the good hope, that by the will of providence not only Srila Prabhupada and Srila Gurudeva had come in my life, but that in my last breath, I will exhale all desire for this world and inhale Sri Krsna-Nama and eventually Sri Radha-Nama, knowing that now Srila Gurudeva is waiting for me to come closer to Him. For all this, I have good hope as it has become my heart's sole desire. Taking shelter in this desire, that Srila Gurudeva has planted in my heart, I am able to bear and witness the strange reality that is created by the material body in which I am living as <i>Go-Dasa</i>, servant of my senses. But in full understanding I am waiting patiently. Srila Gurudeva has promised to help me. Time will tell. Time is my best friend. Sri Krsna himself is eternal time.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Therefore, when my time will come one day, I need not worry any longer for the demands of this body. Having firm faith in the promise of Srila Gurudeva, I am not even worrying too much about the urges of my senses today. Let them urge, I think, let them have their needs fulfilled. Anyway, I am a servant. If it is a question of time only, then I need not worry at all. I will be servant for all eternity. When Sri Krsna comes as eternal time, He may take away that body, and he may give me that body in which I can make Srila Gurudeva happy, if that is my desire in the time of passing away. Whatever will happen, especially in these strange timest that humanity is facing now, the freedom of my desire is eternal, and it is the only price that I can possibly pay for entering into <i>bhajana</i>. Therefore, nothing but all good hope remains.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ***</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In the year of 2009 the European Bhakti Fetsival took place in Venice beach on the beautiful shore of the Adriatic sea in Italy. My whole family arrived a few days early and my wife engaged all our children in cleaning and preparing Srila Gurudeva's quarters, especially his kitchen. In the meantime I was cooking for those Vaishnavis and Vaishnavas who also arrived before the offcial beginning of the festival. Of course, Krsna-devi Mataji and her family would provide food for all, but I had the good fortune to cook for Srimati Syamarani Mataji, as she needed a certain diet. These memories are giving us happiness until today. As I had explored the villages around the festival site days before by bicycle, I knew where nice veggies and fruits were available directly from the farmers. It was June and in that time of the year, the best cherries one can imagine , grow in Italy. Somehow or other I proposed to Srimati Vrinda-devi Mataji, who was part of Srila Gurudeva's 'inner circle' travelling party, that I could buy all ingredients for Srila Gurudeva's cooking. Not only did she approve of that idea, but from that very day on, she went shopping with me for fresh ingredients daily until the end of the festival week.<br><br> When we came back to Srila Gurudeva's appartment, which was a beautiful small house in the midst of a pine forest, Sripad Madhav Maharaj asked me what I was having in my bags. I told him about our shopping. What he didn‘t know: I had bought some extra fine cherries for Srila Gurudeva, beacause I knew that He was so fond of them. I told that I had brought cherries for Gurudeva. So in His typical lovely way Maharaj had me enter Srila Gurudeva's room, indicating that I should offer what I had brought for Srila Gurudeva. When I entered the room, there was only Srila Gurudeva sitting on his bed and chanting, deeply absorbed. I offered my <i>dandavat pranams</i>, yet I was in som fear of what to say. I had never been alone in one room with Srila Gurudeva. So I sat down before Him, and He looked at me, lifting one eyebrow, expressing "Why have you come to me?“ One or two days before I had the good chance to offer a flower garland to Srila Gurudeva just upon His arrival, so I thought, maybe He would remember me – as if Srila Gurudeva could possibly forget anyone He would have met before. I said: "Gurudeva, I have brought some nice cherries for you!“ I stood up and handed over to Him the paper pouch filled with cherries, which were so dark red and so huge, at the same time giving such a fine fragrance. He took the cherries and with surprise He turned over to me with a huge smile saying, as if by buying these cherries I had just done what had been His desire: "Very good! And now, you can bring them to the kitchen.“ <br><br> Seeing my happiness, He kept on smiling and blessed me with His hand. While I was flying out of His room to bring the cherries upstairs into His kitchen, I experienced a totally new ease of being. In this moment I understood, that <i>bhakti</i> is so very easy. If I only can make Srila Gurudeva happy, If I only can do what He likes, then His love will flood my heart, and Love of God will manifest within my very soul.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> ***</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> In 2010, it happend that we got a call from Brajanath Prabhu and he said that Srila Gurudeva will take rest for a few days in a Village called Allershausen near Munich airport. From their He would fly back to India, just before the beginning of <i>Chaturmasya</i>. So by His sweet will Germany was the last country outside of India, that Srila Gurudeva happend to stay in. In those days I was given the rare opportunity to serve a Vaishnava. Regularly I bought food supplements and natural medicines that where meant for Srila Gurudeva's personal use.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Somehow or other we were able to come to that place where Srila Gurudeva stayed, for two days. I am not able to describe, what the atmosphere was like. Looking back, I can say: yes, I knew that in my lifetime I would not be to able to meet Srila Gurudeva with my material eyesight after he would return to India. No one expected that Srila Gurudeva would come to Germany, and indeed hardly anyone knew. My wife Sumukhi and all our four children came, and we could enter Srila Gurudeva's room. There were only very few devotees with Srila Gurudeva: as always Madhav Maharaj, Brajanath Prabhu, and also Harernamananda Prabhu and Shilpakarini, His dear followers who were themselves disciples of Srila Prbahupada. They had arranged the place for Srila Gurudeva to rest and recover from the strains of travelling many hours by airplane. And they made sure that it was calm and peaceful. Not many were there due to this reason.<br><br> So, we were sitting next to Srila Gurudeva's sofa, and we were just sitting there. Understanding, that it may be the last time to ask, I had prepared a small photo album with many pictures of the deities of Sri Sri Gaura-Nityananda, that Srila Gurudeva had installed 10 years before and which we had served ever since. The photographs showed all occasions like bathing ceremonies and so many beautiful dresses, that Sumukhi had sewn herself for the pleasure of Sri Sri Gaura-Nitai over the past few years. It was my long time desire that we would one day be awarded the <i>seva</i> of Sri Radha and Krsna, and thus I expressed my desire to Srila Gurudeva on that day. I asked: 'Srila Gurudeva. Can I show you something, I have brought some pictures for you.“ Srila Gurudeva was in a very deeply absorbed mood. Therefore Sripad Madhav Maharaj asked me with a stern voice, what it was about. It was obvious, that Maharaj did not like Srila Gurudeva to be disturbed by any unnecessary things. Not hesitating, I stood up and opened the photo-book. Suddenly I found myself sitting right next to Srila Gurudeva's sofa, just next to Him, and showing all the pictures. "Very good!“ He said and looked at me, which made me understand that it was rather a kind of pleasure than a disturbance to Srila Gurudeva. Thus encouraged I proceeded with my question: "Srila Gurudeva! Do you allow that we may worship deities of Sri Radha and Krsna in our home?“ And very sweetly, with a waving hand, He said: "No harm, you can do.“ <br><br> Just after that, Srila Gurudeva gave <i>Harinam</i> and also <i>diksha</i> Initiations over Skype, and no one sent us away, as it was such a small gathering in His private room. So all our children were part of the initiation and were blessed by hearing how Srila Gurudeva gave Nama and Mantra. Our smallest children were in addition given malas by Srila Gurudeva so that they would be able to chant purely one day. What more can a father and mother in this world desire? Certainly, Srila Gurudeva has given us all auspiciousness. Now, it is up to us, what we can do with it – keep it firm in our hearts, or not. As far as myself is concerned, I know that I am in a very dangerous situation. All <i>bhakti</i> can be lost, if the desire and endeavour to keep it is not firm.<br><br> When I just announced that we would have to leave now because we had a 4 hours drive back home and school would start next day, one devotee proposed to me that we might drive to the Airport before Gurudeva would arrive there and arrange a wheelchair for Him. I was thinking to do so, but then I counted that we would arrive home so late at night, that it might cause trouble to my family. The airport was in the opoosite direction, it would have been an extra effort to go there. In this very second, again I understood my miserable condition: I was rather ready to scarifice a chance to serve my spiritual master, even if it would be my last chance to offer a rather insignificant <i>seva</i> to him, than to accept minor inconvenience for my family and myself. That is my miserable position, unworthy as I said before, and now you may understand. I am suffering from that for the rest of my life. I can never forget it. I am praying that Srila Gurudeva may forgive me and again gives me a chance to serve Him in the future.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Sri Vaishnava-krpa prarthi</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Tarun Tamal Das<br> Hare Krsna</p> <div class="border border-saffron-300 rounded-md rounded-b-none shadow my-8 bg-orange-100 bg-spacer bg-center"> <div class="px-8 py-8 w-full"> <img class="object-contain sm:max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/srilagurudeva/storage/uploads/E0JDhWFM337Jt4thVvBQj8a0qTwhjn2sQetOcE0j.jpeg" alt="Munich July 24th 2010" /> </div> <div class="px-8 py-4 text-lg font-bold text-center text-white bg-saffron-300"> Munich July 24th 2010 </div></div> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/srilagurudeva/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/livewire/livewire.js?id=90730a3b0e7144480175" data-turbo-eval="false" data-turbolinks-eval="false" ></script><script data-turbo-eval="false" data-turbolinks-eval="false" > if (window.livewire) { console.warn('Livewire: It looks like Livewire\'s @livewireScripts JavaScript assets have already been loaded.
