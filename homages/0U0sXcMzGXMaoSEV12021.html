the opportunity and the heart-felt mood to offer you my unlimited grateful pranams at your lotus feet. As the Ganges provides the water which her worshippers may then offer back to her, may your love and compassion melt my heart so that one day I can bathe your feet with my tears.<br> <br> When I first came to you, I was not looking for a guru. I had met Srila Prabhupada directly at the <i>kumbha mela</i> and received his completely transcendental mercy and inspiration – and after joining ISKCON (after he had already departed) and eventually becoming disappointed with the shelter and guidance that I was being given there, I simply accepted that Srila Prabhupada was my true and eternal benefactor, although I also found myself becoming more and more captivated by the attractions and attached responsibilities and ever-increasing involvements of this world.<br> <br> I finally went to see you after the insistent encouragement of two very dear old friends, your <i>siksa</i> disciples Jagadeesh Das Prabhu (who is also the <i>diksa</i> disciple of Srila Bhakti Pramod Puri Maharaja) and Srila Prabhupada’s <i>diksa</i> disciple Lokaguru Das Prabhu. Both simply said to me that you were going to be in Houston soon, your body was now very advanced in years and apparently weakened and prone to disease, and I should make sure to see you at least once. So I thought, ‘why not?’</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> I also considered you were likely elevated enough to be able to tell me for sure whether the personality I had seen in a very powerful vision the very night after I actually joined this movement in Vrindavan in 1978 and who told me that “you are filled with material desires; but I accept you” was Srila Prabhupada, as I believed. Because in the dream, I was only able to see his lotus feet, which I was tightly grasping while weeping and making prayers – for everything above his ankles was too brilliantly effulgent for me to be able to see.<br> <br> I came to Houston to see you, when you were installing the cornerstone for the <i>matha</i> there. And as I walked into the compound where all the programs were being held (I think it was actually a Durga temple complex supported by the local Hindu community) and so many devotees were congregating, I immediately felt a wonderful mood of natural sweet relatedness there. I could see how the devotees were all laughing and talking together with so much affection, sannyasis at ease with women and children, such a loving family atmosphere. And I was instantly impressed. I thought, if these are the fruits of the tree, then the root of such a tree must be very excellent and qualified. I remembered this mood from when I first came to Srila Prabhupada’s ISKCON, but I had seen it gradually deteriorate as so much division and suspicion and force grew up in its stead.<br> <br> Then when I entered, I saw a couple of old familiar faces, and they were very happy to see me there, and shared something of their own experience. Rai Krsna Prabhu was one such devotee, and he began to tell me how after Srila Prabhupada’s departure he had found his faith weakening and his attention towards his sadhana and his chanting getting less and less, until he came to you, Srila Gurudeva, and he said you gave him some tiny drop of your own conviction and taste for chanting, because suddenly he was totally reinvigorated to chant and hear again … and I was touched and surprised by his being unable to talk further, as he simply became overcome by tears and emotion. I determined I must meet you then, because surely you were qualified to tell me the truth about my dream, whether Srila Prabhupada was indeed my eternal guru.<br> <br> You were staying at the lovely home of one wealthy devoted Indian disciple who was a doctor, and so many devotees were hanging around there also. And I came upon Padmanabha Swami, and we became fast friends in the instant. He assured me he would arrange that I could come and have a private darshan with you later, and so I stayed around the house for the rest of the day, taking lunch <i>prasadam</i> there with the other devotees. As it happened, Maharaja was unable to secure such a private meeting, and then as evening came, all the devotees there gathered in the huge living room area, and then you came down the stairs to give everyone your darshan and to answer any questions.<br> <br> I found myself seated in the middle of perhaps the 4th or 5th row of devotees facing you, so I was very close to you. And I raised my hand when you asked, through Brajanath prabhu, for questions. It seemed as though you nodded right towards me, so I stood up to begin to ask my question. You were seated on a fairly low seat, and everyone else in the room was sitting cross-legged in front of you, while plenty more devotees had packed in at the sides, all standing up. But as I began to speak, you ignored me and gave your attention to an Indian gentleman seated right in front of you, several rows ahead of me. So there I was, feeling large and clumsy and utterly foolish standing above everyone else, as I sat back down again. But as soon as you had finished answering that devotee’s question, in Hindi, you looked towards me and gestured for me to ask. So again I stood up, and I began to speak.<br> <br> I said something like “so when I joined this movement, at the Krsna Balarama temple in Vrindavan, I had an intensely strong dream that night, that I want to ask you about…” and then Brajanath prabhu interrupted, so as to ‘translate’ my English into a language you could understand. At that point I discovered that you understood English best if it was pre-digested and then quite covered by a thick Dutch flavor! So as Brajanath prabhu finished ‘translating’ my first sentence, I continued. And as he began to repeat that sentence also, something began to happen inside me. I interrupted, him, saying ‘no, no, not that!’ And you looked at me Srila Gurudeva, for the first time, and I could see that you were completely seeing me, and my heart just opened, and I found myself finally acknowledging the pain and confusion in my heart, and pouring it out to you.<br> <br> I said, “Oh Swami-ji (because I didn’t know at that time that Swami was Srila Prabhupada’s actual sannyasa name, and I was used to speaking to all Indian sannyasis with that honorific), I have been trying to be a devotee for over 30 years. And still I don’t know who I am or what I am doing!” And I began to weep helplessly before you. And you looked at me so intently and compassionately, and you assured me with a promise I hear so many times inside myself, that continues to assure me even while everything around me is so often confusing and doubtful. You said “I will help you. I will give you <i>siksa</i>, and tomorrow, I will give you mantras.” And I slowly sat back down, not knowing quite what had happened, only that I felt so very relieved, and I could understand that my life had suddenly changed, completely unexpectedly, but irrevocably.<br> <br> The next day I went out on the morning walk with you. I stepped forward to say that: “Srila Gurudeva, for several decades I have been worshipping Srila Prabhupada, so that my heart naturally goes to him. So although you have given me diksa, I do not know how I can just transfer that love from him to you.” And I also asked you whether the same guru comes life after life to help his disciples, ‘janme janme prabhu sei’?</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> At first you called Padmanabha Swami to answer, and he explained how Guru is one, etc. Then you told me that the disciple should anyhow think that it is his guru. I then slipped to the back once more, not feeling I had any right to be so close among your close and senior men. But then after a couple of minutes you suddenly stopped, and called out, “where is that boy again?” Seeing me, you beckoned me forwards, and looking at me, you told me, “You can do like that, it is OK.” I understood you were telling me that I could continue to hold Srila Prabhupada as my guru in my heart. And the next day, something amazing took place. I suddenly felt free in my heart to worship you as my spiritual master, that although Srila Prabhupada remained so very dear to me, and his blessings so intrinsic to my spiritual birth, you were my guru. Your complete detachment, your giving me full permission to follow my heart, dissolved any resistance or confusion in my heart, allowed me to see things clearly and without any pressure or resistance to the same.<br> <br> Then I began to read what is still one of my favorite books – “Gaura-vani-pracarine.” And it blew my mind. I had thought I had a fair idea as to who Srila Prabhupada was; but in this book you gave me such understanding as to who he was, and what was his mission and message, and to what is the actual position and function of Sri Guru, that I had never had any sense of before! I realized that you were actually giving my relationship with Srila Prabhupada also! And indeed with the greater world-wide family of pure vaisnavas. I also started reading Acarya Sri Kesari – your biography of Srila Paramgurudeva, Srila Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Maharaja. At first, I felt confronted at the very first page, your Dedication, where you glorified your spiritual master as “the best amongst the 10th generation of descendants in the bhagavat-parampara from Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu.” I was thinking, “no – how could I accept this! Srila (AC Bhaktivedanta Swami) Prabhupada is the best!”</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> But as time went by, first I could understand how the competition on the spiritual platform has only winners, no-one ever loses; so that yes, to every disciple, his guru is the greatest and best empowered manifestation of akhanda-guru Sri Nityananda Ram. And then as I heard and read more, I could understand something of the glories of Srila Paramgurudeva – whose book “Beyond Nirvana” became another of my favorite books! – and also of his relationship with our Srila Prabhupada, how he was Srila Prabhupada’s dear friend and senior godbrother and siksa-guru, and that his blessings and encouragement were also significant factors in Srila Prabhupada’s success. The Vaisnava never imagines he is acting by virtue of his own independent will and strength – he is always the recipient of the power and blessings given to him by the Vaisnavas, especially as contained within the order of his gurus. And that while it is entirely appropriate for any disciple to regard his own guru as the most prominent and greatest of all the <i>vaisnavas</i>, such regard is always inside of the context of great respect and appreciation and love for all the other Vaisnavas as also being empowered manifestations of the mercy and energy of Sri Krsna Caitanya and Lord Nityananda. And that it is only those very neophyte devotees struggling to gain a foothold on the <i>kanistha</i> platform whose sense of loyalty and respect and gratitude, of <i>guru-sraddha,</i> is clouded by an idea that other pure Vaisnavas are necessarily inferior. So that there may be a confusion between the heartfelt adoration and worship of my Guru, and the still prominent false egoic conception that whatever I have accepted must be superior, as a means to establish my own importance and superior position. In other words, there is a distinction between actual glorification of (my) <b><i>Guru</i></b> and desire to glorify the fact that he is <b><i>my</i></b> (guru).<br> <br> Now – it has been a decade since you left our physical vision. And although you have told again and again, you never leave us, you are closer than the air we breathe … my material conditioning is so strong that I am only sometimes aware of your presence, or rather, of your absence, and I am able to actually cry out for you, and in this way experience the beginnings of some semblance of actual attachment and affection for you in my heart. I know I am fortunate beyond words that you chose to appear in my life, and to accept me. And I feel that aside from this, I have wasted my life, and indeed have failed to really avail myself of the opportunities you have given me to serve and remember you and to engage wholeheartedly in real <i>bhajan</i>.</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> So I can but pray and hope that if I have done anything at all that pleases you, please grant me an opportunity to come to you much earlier in the next life, and to be trained to serve you and become absorbed in hearing from you right from the beginning, instead of spending so many years being the hopeless servant of maya, developing such commitment to enjoy her false promises, fully enamored by her offerings without a clue that anything else even existed!<br> <br> Thank you forever for coming here into my dream-like condition of life to interrupt that maya-business as usual, and to undertake the burden of trying to wake me up, as I fight with all I have to remain firmly asleep and seemingly warmly nestled in the lap of the <i>maya-pisacini</i>.<br> <br> Jaya Jaya Srila Gurudeva!</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Aspiring for the mercy of Srila Gurudeva</p> <p class="ce-paragraph"> Narasingha Das</p> </div> </div> </div> </main> <div id="footer" class="w-full bg-dark text-gray-100 py-2 px-4"> <div class="container xl:container-xl mx-auto flex justify-around flex-grow"> <div><a class="font-semibold" href="/srilagurudeva/note-from-seva-team" title="A Note from the Editorial Team">A Note from the Editorial Team</a></div> <div class="hidden sm:block">2021 &copy; All rights reserved</div> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/livewire/livewire.js?id=90730a3b0e7144480175" data-turbo-eval="false" data-turbolinks-eval="false" ></script><script data-turbo-eval="false" data-turbolinks-eval="false" > if (window.livewire) { console.warn('Livewire: It looks like Livewire\'s @livewireScripts JavaScript assets have already been loaded.
